 Reach Orbits, or successfully return. Those were the pivotal moments for Starship, and it's when we realized Raptor 2 had truly fulfilled its role. But with even bigger goals on the horizon, SpaceX needed something more advanced, Enter Raptor 3. This new version brings insane and unbelievable upgrades, sparking excitement about the future of rocket engines. But to create unprecedented breakthroughs, Raptor 3 promises to push the boundaries of what's possible in space exploration. What could be next for SpaceX with this incredible engine? Let's dive into the details on today's episode of Great SpaceX. August was a significant month for SpaceX, with Raptor 3 emerging as a major milestone in the development of Starship. This new engine version has captured widespread attention, particularly for its innovative design and engineering. As every day astronaut noted, this is absolutely absurd engineering to simplify an engine down like this. Visually, Raptor 3 is much neater and simpler, embodying Elon Musk's philosophy, The best part is no parts. Interestingly, the new design aligns with previous hints, indicating that SpaceX has been planning this upgrade for quite some time. When revealing the first image of Raptor 3, Musk highlighted the immense effort behind its development. The amount of work required to simplify the Raptor engine internalize secondary flow paths and add regenerative cooling for exposed components was staggering. Simplification is something SpaceX has tackled before, transitioning from Raptor 1 to Raptor 2 by removing or integrating small and vulnerable parts. This integration demonstrates SpaceX's high level of engineering as they've managed to conceal complex systems while maintaining their functionality. One of the most notable changes is the removal of the heat shield. Musk explained, it no longer requires a heat shield. Everything is regeneratively cooled. The heat shield previously installed to protect the engine from external impacts is no longer necessary. Instead, advanced cooling systems will manage the engine's heat during operation. In production, SpaceX continues to leverage 3D printing technology. Musk confirmed, many of them are 3D metal printed into the wall of the part. This technology, now a staple in the industry, has drastically improved production speed. First seen in the transition from Raptor 1 to Raptor 2, with Raptor 3, SpaceX continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in rocket engine design and production. The new upgrades have given Raptor 3 several significant advantages. But before we dive into these, please like, share the video and subscribe to our channel. Your support helps us continue to grow. First, the removal and integration of sensitive parts have made the engine more reliable, reducing the risks that have played previous flights with the engines in super heavy. While there has been progress after each flight, the issues with the Raptor engine have not been fully resolved. The strong simplification in Raptor 3 aims to increase the success rate for future flights. It'd be fantastic if Raptor 3 achieves a successful debut flight. Musk mentioned in a star-based interview that SpaceX is replacing the flanges with a welding method. While bolts, screws, and flanges make assembly and disassembly easier, they also pose risks of damage, leakage, and heat accumulation. Welding overcomes these issues, making the engine more resilient during harsh processes like lift-off or reentry. Although this method might complicate maintenance, it drives SpaceX to further refine the engine, potentially reducing the need for frequent maintenance. The upgrades also bring other advantages to Raptor 3. It's confidently stated that its lighter has more thrust and is more efficient than Raptor 2. Regarding mass, the welding method and the removal of the heat shield have allowed SpaceX to optimize the engine's weight. According to SpaceX, Raptor 1 weighed 2.08 tons. Raptor 2 was 1.63 tons, and Raptor 3 now comes in at just 1.525 tons. While the reduction isn't as dramatic as some might have expected, it's still an impressive achievement. As for thrust, last year's test of Raptor 3 shocked the world when it was tested at 269 tons of thrust. However, after Musk's recent update we now know that Raptor 3's thrust has reached 280 tons at sea level and 306 tons in a vacuum. This increase in thrust will significantly impact the total power of starship, a topic we'll explore further later. What excites me the most about this upgrade is how it will revolutionize one of the key factors that has set SpaceX apart from the rest. Production Earlier, I discussed SpaceX's rapid progression from the Raptor 1 to the Raptor 2 engines. To illustrate the production of a Raptor 1 engine initially took SpaceX around 11 days. However, with the Raptor 2, that time was reduced to just 2 days, and eventually to a remarkable one day per engine. This significant improvement underscores the advantages of simplification in design. When comparing these production speeds to other engines in the industry including the Raptor 1, the difference is striking. Take Blue Origins BE4 engine for example. Although the exact production time for the BE4 is unclear, it's speculated that it could take months or even up to a year to complete one engine. In addition to the time savings, the cost per Raptor 2 engine has dropped to an astonishingly low figure between 1 and 2 million dollars. When scaled for mass production, this cost could decrease to as little as $200,000 per engine. However, speed alone isn't sufficient to meet SpaceX's ambitious goal of launching hundreds or even thousands of starships per year. This is where the Raptor 3 comes in. With the simplified design I have mentioned, production rates could potentially reach dozens of engines per day, a rate typically associated with manufacturing industries, not the rocket industry. This capability will be crucial to meeting future launch demands as SpaceX aims to build and fly vast numbers of starships annually. The simplicity of the Raptor 3 also promises to drive costs down to unprecedented levels, though it's difficult to predict just how low these costs will go once mass production begins. Another significant advantage of the Raptor 3 is its ability to enable rapid refurbishment and reflight. Musk has set an ambitious goal of turning around the super heavy booster within an hour and launching the Starship daily, achieving this with the current engine version is challenging. But the streamlined design of the Raptor 3 will make refurbishment faster and more efficient. This could increase the Starships turnaround speed to match or even surpass that of the current Falcon 9. These advancements are essential for the long-term mission of Mars colonization. Given the varying distance between Earth and Mars, launches must be precisely timed making these missions exceptionally costly. The advantages of the Raptor 3 will be even more critical in this context. Before we get there, the Raptor 3 will play a pivotal role in SpaceX's upcoming developments, which includes several key changes. SpaceX has already begun producing V2 prototypes, starting with the S33 and more prototypes are on the way. This ramp-up in production will create a significant demand for engines, unlike the previous version, where Starship was produced at a relatively slow pace, the new version is expected to be manufactured at an unprecedented speed, particularly with the implementation of an automated production line at the Star Factory. Just consider the goal of 25 launches per year at Starbase to grasp the scale of this demand. A demand that only the Raptor 3 can likely meet. That's not enough to convince you, let's examine another critical aspect. Total thrust. In an April presentation, Musk highlighted that the super heavy boosters thrust would reach 8,240 tons, with the Starship adding another 1600 tons. This far exceeds the limits of the Raptor 2. With these new thrust parameters, Starship V2 is projected to achieve a maximum lift-off thrust of 9,240 tons, or 20.4 million pounds, surpassing any rocket currently, in the industry. I'm eager to see this in action in the near future. However, Raptor 3 may also serve as an intermediary step toward an even more powerful engine. Musk has hinted that future Raptor versions could achieve a thrust of 330 tons, potentially pushing the super heavy lift-off thrust beyond 10,000 tons, or over 24 million pounds. These aren't just concepts. They are integral to the plans for Starship Florida or Starship Starbase. Such advancements would not only surpass all current rockets, but also any that have existed in the past or are planned for the near future. More than anything, the Raptor 3 is poised to usher in a new era for SpaceX. This is the moment when traditional concepts of rockets and engines will be redefined. Imagine an engine that is lighter, yet more powerful, simpler, faster-produce, cheaper, and more reliable. What could be better than that? Well, it's impossible to predict how many more versions of Starship or Raptor will emerge. For now, let's embrace the groundbreaking moments that the Raptor 3 will bring in the near future. Are you ready for this? Well folks, that's about it for today's episode. Thank you so much for tuning in, and as always, this has been Kevin from GreatSpaceX. Until next time, keep looking up.
