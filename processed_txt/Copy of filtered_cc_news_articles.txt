CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX had a royal audience as it launched a satellite for Luxembourg. The Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Wednesday afternoon from Cape Canaveral, Florida, hoisting GovSat-1 for the government of Luxembourg and SES, the country's prime satellite operator, SES. The satellite will support both military and civilian security efforts. Witnessing the launch were Luxembourg's Prince Guillaume and his wife, Stephanie. The country's prime minister, Xavier Bettel, and other high-ranking officials also were present. The rocket's first-stage booster — which also flew last spring — was not recovered this time. Instead, it dropped into the Atlantic. With GovSat-1 now in orbit, SpaceX can focus on next week's debut of its new, big Falcon Heavy rocket. The test flight is scheduled for Tuesday.


*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Space Age hand-me-downs are soaring to a whole new level. On Tuesday, SpaceX plans to launch its first rocket for NASA. The unmanned Falcon 9 — last used in June — will carry up a Dragon capsule that's also flown on a previous space station supply run. NASA's International Space Station manager, Kirk Shireman, says the risk of launching a recycled rocket is about the same as for a brand new one. He says he'll be just as anxious as he always is at every launch. As before, the first-stage booster will attempt to land back at Cape Canaveral, Florida. This will be the first launch in more than a year from Launch Complex 40. The pad was ruined when a SpaceX rocket exploded during testing in September 2016.


*WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A space launch has been scrubbed from a remote launch site in New Zealand after an engine glitch caused engineers to abort the flight. The command to abort Tuesday came two seconds after the engine of the Rocket Lab Electron rocket fired on its launch pad at Mahia Peninsula on North Island's east coast. There was no immediate explanation for the launch attempt being called off, although mission control said the problem had been reported as the engine built toward liftoff. In a tweet, Rocket Lab said the launch of the rocket nicknamed "'Still Testing' (was) scrubbed for the day while team reviews data. Updates on a new attempt to follow." The 23-meter (75-foot) rocket had three satellites on board for Tuesday's launch, each about the size of a shoebox.


*BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) — SpaceX is seeking up to $5 million more in new state funding to build a commercial spaceport in Texas, a high-profile project that's behind schedule after breaking ground in 2014. SpaceX is seeking the money to help build infrastructure related to the launch facility at Boca Chica beach outside Brownsville, the Austin American-Statesman reported . The Cameron County Spaceport Development Corp. recently applied for the $5 million at the request of SpaceX, according to county Judge Eddie Trevino Jr. The new money for the project would come from the Spaceport Trust Fund, a state economic development fund. The application was due last month. Gov. Greg Abbott's economic development and tourism division is currently considering the application, said a spokeswoman for the governor. About $15.3 million in state funding has already been set aside for the planned spaceport, but less than $3 million has been used so far. SpaceX has also returned a small portion of the funds pledged from the state's jobs-focused Texas Enterprise Fund because the company fell short of hiring goals as the project couldn't keep pace with its original timetable. The California-based company was founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk with the goal of reducing the cost of space travel and eventually facilitating the colonization of Mars. Musk initially said that SpaceX will invest $100 million at the site, predicting it could send up rockets by late 2016, however that date has since been pushed to at least late 2018. ___ Information from: Austin American-Statesman, http://www.statesman.com


*A space launch was scrubbed Tuesday from a remote launch site in New Zealand after an engine glitch caused engineers to abort the flight. The command to abort came two seconds after the engine of the Rocket Lab Electron rocket fired on its launch pad at Mahia Peninsula on North Island's east coast. There was no immediate explanation for the launch attempt being called off, although mission control said the problem had been reported as the engine built toward liftoff . In a tweet, Rocket Lab said the launch of the rocket nicknamed "'Still Testing' (was) scrubbed for the day while team reviews data." It said in a statement that the weather is not favorable for a launch on Wednesday, so a new launch would be attempted "no earlier than" Thursday afternoon. The 23-meter (75-foot) rocket had three satellites on board for Tuesday's launch, each about the size of a shoebox. Founded by New Zealander Peter Beck, the company last May reached space with its first test launch, only to abort the mission when a communication glitch occurred. Rocket Lab has official approval to conduct three test launches and sees an emerging market in delivering lots of small devices, some not much bigger than a smartphone, into low Earth orbit. The satellites would be used for everything from monitoring crops to providing internet service. The company hopes to begin commercial launches next year and eventually launch one rocket every week.


*Space Age hand-me-downs are soaring to a whole new level. On Tuesday, SpaceX plans to launch its first recycled rocket for NASA. The unmanned Falcon 9 — last used in June — will carry up a Dragon capsule that's also flown on a previous space station supply run. NASA's International Space Station manager, Kirk Shireman, said the risk of launching a recycled rocket is about the same as for a brand new one. He expects to be just as anxious as he always is at every launch. "It's still a dangerous business," he told reporters Monday. Although NASA's best rocket experts conducted an extensive review of the recycled and meticulously inspected booster, there is never "zero risk," he pointed out. The private SpaceX has launched recycled rockets three times before, on commercial satellite deliveries. And back in June, SpaceX launched a previously flown Dragon to the space station. This latest Dragon to fly — loaded with nearly 5,000 pounds of food, gear and experiments, and likely some Christmas presents — first flew in 2015. While the notion of reusable rockets is hardly new — NASA's now retired space shuttles reused main engines and booster segments — SpaceX is intent on driving down launch costs by salvaging its boosters and other components, and reflying them again and again. "This is the beginning of rapid and reliable reusability," said Jessica Jensen, a SpaceX manager. "We want to be able to send thousands of people into space, not just tens, and so reusability is a very key part of that, and we're excited because tomorrow is just one step closer to that." As before, the first-stage booster will attempt to land back at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This will be the first launch in more than a year from Launch Complex 40. The pad was ruined when a SpaceX rocket exploded during testing in September 2016. In a $50 million rebuild, SpaceX made the pad more robust, burying support equipment and fuel lines under concrete and steel. ——— Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/


*SpaceX is about to launch a few tons of research to the International Space Station — plus ice cream. An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to blast off at 12:31 p.m. Monday from Florida's Kennedy Space Center. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo. That includes 20 mice. The Dragon capsule is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream for the station's crew of six, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. As usual on these cargo flights, SpaceX will try to land its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral.


*A SpaceX rocket is ready to deliver one of the most high-tech payloads ever to the International Space Station. The launch is scheduled for 12:31 p.m. ET. on Monday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center is Florida. It marks the 12th unmanned resupply mission that SpaceX -- the private space exploration company headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- has conducted for NASA since 2012. Cargo missions are always packed with some interesting payloads -- typically several tons of experiment equipment, food and other provisions. But Monday's mission will carry something the space station has never seen before: A supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, dubbed the "Spaceborne Computer." If it works, it could be the most powerful commercial computer ever to operate in space. Astronauts aboard the space station already have a bunch of devices you'd find at your local electronics store -- including HP laptops. But a supercomputer is something different. It's a much more powerful piece of hardware that can crunch massive amounts of data and send the results to other computers in just moments. According to Mark Fernandez, the HPE engineer who is heading up this new experiment, the space-bound supercomputer will have the ability to make one trillion calculations in a single second -- about 30 to 100 times more powerful than your average desktop computer. Julie Robinson, the chief scientist for NASA's space station program, said if this supercomputer can function in the harsh conditions of space -- it'll be very exciting news for companies down here on earth. Robinson points out that a huge point of interest for the private sector is taking high-quality satellite images of earth in order to track things like crop growth or oil exploration. "What's happening is -- just as your TV now has so much more resolution -- the same thing is happening with [satellite imagery]," she said. But the high-definition images require 200 to 300 times more data, which can clog up the communication pipeline between earth and space. That's where a supercomputer on board the space station would become hugely valuable, Robinson told CNNMoney. "If you can process the data on board [the space station], you then only need to send down a subset of the data that's actually needed," she said. Will the supercomputer work? We'll find out soon enough. After launch on Monday, SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft will detach from the top portion of the rocket. It'll then fire up its own engines and spend about two days traveling through orbital space. Then, it'll dock with the space station, and the astronauts on board can collect the payload. Fernandez said HPE has volunteered to have its payload removed last, so it'll be a few days into September by the time the supercomputer makes its way onto the space station and is plugged in. "If it powers up, that's going to be my first relief. I will be very excited then," Fernandez told CNNMoney.

*Getty Image Billionaire Elon Musk has popped up in some unexpected contexts online — regarding everything from his fantastically fierce meeting behavior to tangling with Rick and Morty — in recent days, but now he’s focusing on a much more vital subject. That is, Musk recognizes that Puerto Rico needs more help than President Trump tossing paper towels and obsessing over canned chicken in order to recover from Hurricane Maria’s destruction. So, Musk is offering to help rebuild the U.S. territory’s entire power grid. How exactly does the Tesla founder plan to accomplish such a task? By way of solar power and batteries. Through the Tesla-incorporated SolarCity, Musk has embarked upon such endeavors in American Samoa, where the island of Ta’u can now store three days of energy in a solar grid. Musk tweeted that Tesla can bring the same results to Puerto Rico, but he’s leaving the decision up to the government and the people, of course: “The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR.” In response, the Puerto Rican government appears to be taking Musk’s statement seriously. Governor Ricardo Rossello tweeted, “Let’s talk.” @elonMusk Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project. https://t.co/McnHKwisqc — Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 6, 2017 Musk and Rossello are actually expected to discuss the issue on Friday afternoon. The project would obviously take months to put into fruition, but residents and businesses were already staring down four to six months without power following Hurricane Maria’s devastation. And with FEMA quietly removing electricity and water stats concerning Puerto Rico from its website, the U.S. territory can use all the help that Musk can offer. (Via CNBC & BBC)

*STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS & USED WITH PERMISSION After an exhaustive investigation, SpaceX engineers have identified the most likely cause of the spectacular explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket during a pre-launch test Sept. 1 that destroyed the booster and its $195 million satellite payload, the company announced Monday. SpaceX engineers believe the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station mishap was triggered by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank, one of three used to pressurize the second stage liquid oxygen tank. Putting corrective actions in place, the company said Monday it plans to resume flights with a launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to boost 10 Iridium NEXT satellite telephone relay stations into orbit. It is not yet known when SpaceX plans to resume flights from Cape Canaveral. Launch complex 40 at the Florida Air Force station was heavily damaged in the Sept. 1 mishap, and the company plans to use a repurposed space shuttle launch pad at the nearby Kennedy Space Center for its next Falcon 9 flight from Florida. Sources indicate the first flight from Kennedy will be another commercial mission. The next SpaceX flight to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, the company’s 10th under contract to NASA, is expected to take place some time after the commercial mission. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket uses super-cooled, or “densified,” liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene fuel to provide additional performance during ascent. To achieve and maintain the desired low temperatures, propellant loading begins just 35 minutes before launch. To push propellants to the rocket’s engines, the Falcon 9 uses highly pressurized helium stored in aluminum bottles, wrapped in a tough, insulating carbon composite material. The bottles, known as composite overwrap pressure vessels, or COPVs, are mounted inside the propellant tanks, submerged in frigid liquid oxygen and chilled kerosene. On Sept. 1, about five minutes before a planned test firing of the Falcon’s nine Merlin 1D first stage engines — a routine pre-launch test for SpaceX — the second stage suddenly exploded in a spectacular conflagration that was caught on video and widely seen around the world. The rocket and it’s $195 million payload, a commercial communications satellite, were destroyed, causing heavy damage to launch complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Just 93 milliseconds elapsed from the first signs of trouble to the explosion. “Investigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events,” SpaceX said in a statement posted to its website. “Because the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris. “To validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.” SpaceX is generally tight-lipped when it comes to technical details, and the statement posted Monday provided only a general overview of the team’s findings. It said accident investigators “concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed.” “Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner,” the company said. Investigators believe those extremely low temperatures may have caused some of that trapped oxygen to solidify. In any case, when the tank was pressurized, trapped oxygen pushing against the carbon overwrap fibers likely generated friction “leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.” Liquid oxygen has a temperature of around minus 298 degrees Fahrenheit, but SpaceX chills the propellant to around minus 340 degrees for use aboard the Falcon 9. The RP-1 kerosene fuel, which normally is stored at a room temperature 70 degrees, also is chilled. The lower temperatures increase the propellants’ density. A rocket engine’s thrust is directly proportional to the rate propellants are consumed and expelled. By “densifying” the Falcon 9 propellants, more fuel can be stored and pumped through the engines, increasing performance. While earlier rockets, including the Titan 2 booster used to launch NASA’s Gemini spacecraft in the 1960s, used propellant cooling to increase density, and thus engine performance, the upgraded Falcon 9 is believed to be the first utilizing super-cooled cryogenic oxygen. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in 2015, when propellant cooling was first implemented in the Falcon 9, that “we’re sub-cooling the propellant, particularly the liquid oxygen, close to its freezing point, which increases the density quite significantly.” Failure investigators “identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX (solidified oxygen) in buckles under the overwrap,” the company said in its statement. “The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.” The company did not provide any details about those earlier helium loading procedures but said it plans to redesign the helium bottles in the long term “to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.” The Sept. 1 failure was the second involving the Falcon 9’s second-stage helium pressurization system. During a June 2015 launch to deliver supplies to the space station, a strut holding a second-stage helium tank in place inside the liquid oxygen tank failed, allowing the helium bottle to shoot up and crash into the top of the oxygen tank, triggering a catastrophic rupture. It was SpaceX’s first outright Falcon 9 failure in 19 launchings dating back to the rocket’s maiden flight in June 2010. After taking steps to ensure all internal struts met design specifications, SpaceX launched nine successful missions in a row before the Sept. 1 launch pad disaster, all of them using densified propellants.


*A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket climbed into space Monday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center atop a column of gleaming exhaust, shooting a commercial resupply vessel toward the International Space Station with research projects looking into cosmic rays, the origin of Parkinson’s disease, the utility of small satellites and an experimental radiation-tolerant supercomputer. Crammed with more than 6,400 pounds (2,900 kilograms) of supplies, the Dragon capsule bolted on top of the Falcon 9 rocket also carried computer and camera gear, components to maintain the station’s life support system and medical equipment, and provisions for the station’s six-person crew, including clothing, fresh food and ice cream. The 213-foot-tall (65-meter) rocket took off from pad 39A at the Florida spaceport at 12:31:37 p.m. EDT (1631:37 GMT), pitched toward the northeast to align with the space station’s orbit, and roared through scattered clouds before disappearing into a blue summertime sky. Nine Merlin 1D main engines at the base of the booster generated 1.7 million pounds of thrust, pushing the rocket into the stratosphere before the first stage switched off and fell away at an altitude of 40 miles (65 kilometers). A single Merlin engine fired on the Falcon 9’s upper stage to power the Dragon capsule into orbit. Glowing red-hot, the second stage engine throttled up to more than 200,000 pounds of thrust for its six-and-a-half minute firing. Meanwhile, in a maneuver now common during SpaceX launches, the first stage flipped around with guided pulses of cold nitrogen gas to point tail first, then reignited three of its Merlin engines to boost itself back forward Cape Canaveral. Two more braking maneuvers were needed to slow down the descending rocket, steering it back to the coast with the help of aerodynamic fins before extending four landing legs and settling on a concrete target at Landing Zone 1 less than eight minutes after liftoff, around 9 miles (15 kilometers) south of the Falcon 9’s departure point at pad 39A. “From what I’ve heard, it’s right on the bullseye and (had a) very soft touchdown, so it’s a great pre-flown booster ready to go for the next time,” said Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX’s vice president of flight reliability. SpaceX has reused two of its recovered first stage boosters to date, and engineers are prepping another previously-flown rocket for a mission with an SES communications satellite this fall. The rocket launched Monday was a fresh vehicle, but its landing legs were scavenged from a vehicle flown on a previous mission, Koenigsmann said. The upper stage continued rocketing into orbit, turning off its engine just after the nine-minute point in the flight, then deploying the Dragon capsule into an on-target slightly egg-shaped orbit averaging around 175 miles (280 kilometers) above the planet. “The second stage went into a near-perfect orbit (and) deployed Dragon,” Koenigsmann said in a media briefing around two hours after the launch. “Dragon primed propellant and has performed the first co-elliptic burn at this point in time,” he said, referring to the first in a series of thruster firings on tap to guide the capsule toward the space station. The supply ship’s power-generating solar arrays extended shortly after it arrived in space, while the Falcon 9’s second stage reignited for a de-orbit maneuver to avoid the creation of space junk. With Monday’s launch, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket family has accomplished 39 missions since debuting in 2010, and 38 of them have succeeded in their primary objectives. Those statistics do not include a Falcon 9 rocket that exploded before takeoff during testing on the launch pad, destroying an Israeli communications satellite. SpaceX has landed the Falcon 9’s first stage intact 14 times in 19 tries since the company attempted its first rocket landing on a barge at sea in 2015. Six of those touchdowns have occurred at Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral. The automated cargo freighter will reach its destination Wednesday, when astronaut Jack Fischer will take command of the space station’s Canadian-built robotic arm to capture the commercial spaceship around 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT). The robotic arm will install Dragon on the space station’s Harmony module for a planned 32-day stay. While astronauts inside the station will unpack cargo inside Dragon’s internal cabin, the Canadian and Japanese robotic arms will transfer a NASA-funded cosmic ray sensor to a mounting post outside the Kibo laboratory. Derived from an instrument carried aloft on high-altitude balloons, the Cosmic Ray Energetics and Mass, or CREAM, payload will spend at least three years sampling particles sent speeding through the universe by cataclysmic supernova explosions, and perhaps other exotic phenomena like dark matter. Scientists think the subatomic particles could hold the key to unlocking mysteries about the universe. One experiment stowed inside the capsule’s pressurized section will investigate the origins of Parkinson’s disease in a bid to find a therapy that could slow or halt its development, and another will study the affects of spaceflight on the development of bioengineered lung tissue, potentially helping scientists lessen the chance of organ rejection in transplant patients. A supercomputer developed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise will spend at least a year on the space station, helping engineers gauge the ruggedness of commercial computer components in the harsh conditions of space. Most computers sent into space are physically hardened to withstand radiation, cosmic rays, and other rigors of spaceflight. Hewlett Packard said its “spaceborne computer” experiment was hardened with software, reducing the time, money and weight of the supercomputer. The experimental computer passed at least 146 safety tests and certifications to win NASA approval for the trip to the space station. If it works, Hewlett Packard officials said it could help future space missions, including a human expedition to Mars, have the latest computer technology. Four small satellites inside the Dragon capsule will be moved inside the space station for deployment later this year. The biggest of the bunch, named Kestrel Eye 2M, is a pathfinder for a potential constellation of Earth-imaging spacecraft for the U.S. military. About the size of a dorm room refrigerator, the Kestrel Eye 2M satellite was developed by the Army’s Space and Missile Defense Command over the last five years. Three CubeSats sponsored by NASA will test technologies for compact telescopes that could help astronomers observe stars and search for exoplanets, demonstrate a more reliable small satellite design, and study space weather. Monday’s Falcon 9 flight was the first of three launches scheduled from Cape Canaveral in the next 11 days. A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket is scheduled to roll out Wednesday to pad 41 at the Cape ahead of liftoff Friday at 8:03 a.m. EDT (1203 GMT) with a NASA satellite designed to track rockets climbing into space and relay communications between scientific spacecraft in orbit around Earth. An Orbital ATK Minotaur 4 rocket is being readied for launch at 11:15 p.m. EDT Aug. 25 (0315 GMT Aug. 26) from Cape Canaveral’s pad 46 with a military space surveillance mission. The next mission on SpaceX’s manifest is scheduled for Aug. 24 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. A Falcon 9 rocket will haul the Taiwanese Formosat 5 Earth observation satellite into a polar orbit, and its first stage will attempt a return to a barge downrange in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX’s team at the Kennedy Space Center will prepare a Falcon 9 to deploy the U.S. Air Force’s reusable X-37B spaceplane no earlier than Sept. 7. Email the author.

*SpaceX’s next Falcon 9 rocket rolled out of its hangar and up the ramp to Kennedy Space Center’s launch pad 39A Sunday in preparation for liftoff on a two-day trek ferrying more than 6,400 pounds of supplies and experiments to the International Space Station. Workers at the launch pad spent Sunday afternoon installing last-minute cargo into the pressurized cabin of SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft mounted to the end of the rocket. The “late load” items included a habitat with 20 research mice, and a host of biological experiments, freezers and fresh food. Liftoff is set for 12:31 p.m. EDT (1631 GMT) Monday, with arrival at the space station scheduled for Wednesday. The robotic resupply run will mark the 39th launch of a Falcon 9 rocket, and the 11th SpaceX launch this year. SpaceX intends to recover the rocket’s first stage with a propulsive vertical landing at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station a few minutes after liftoff, aiming to land a rocket intact for the 14th time. The Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket flying Monday are newly-manufactured, except for the landing legs at the base of the first stage, which were previously flown. Email the author.

*Look back on last week’s blastoff of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral with NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The TESS mission will search for planets orbiting the stars in our solar neighborhood, finding worlds that are prime candidates for follow-up observations by more powerful telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope set for launch in 2020. TESS lifted off Wednesday, April 18, from Cape Canaveral’s Complex 40 launch pad aboard a Falcon 9 rocket at 6:51:30 p.m. EDT (2251:30 GMT), two days later than planned to allow SpaceX time to complete additional guidance, navigation and control analysis on the launcher. These images taken by NASA, SpaceX and Spaceflight Now photographers show the 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket blasting off from Cape Canaveral, climbing to the east over the Atlantic Ocean, and dropping its first stage booster for a return trip to Earth for a landing on SpaceX’s downrange drone ship.

*An Indian rocket deployed 104 spacecraft into orbit 300 miles above Earth on Tuesday, the largest flock pack of satellites ever launched on a single booster. The satellites from India, the United States, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates will take pictures of planet Earth, monitor the environment, validate new technologies, and serve as tools in the education and training of future aerospace engineers. The smooth flight notched 38 straight successful missions for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, India’s workhorse launcher, and nearly tripled the record for the most spacecraft ever sent into orbit on one rocket, besting a mark set by a Russian-Ukrainian Dnepr booster in 2014. “This remarkable feat by ISRO (the Indian Space Research Organization) is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation,” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted. “India salutes our scientists.” The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, India’s workhorse rocket, blasted off at 0358 GMT Wednesday (10:58 p.m. EST Tuesday) from the Satish Dhawan Space Center on the country’s east coast about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Chennai. Flying in the PSLV XL configuration with six enlarged solid rocket boosters, the 144-foot-tall (44-meter) launcher took off on 1.7 million pounds of thrust. Four of the boosters fired with the PSLV’s solid-fueled first stage at liftoff, and two other strap-on motors ignited 25 seconds later. The four ground-lit motors burned out and separated around T+plus 1 minute, 10 seconds. The two air-lit boosters peeled away from the PSLV at T+plus 1 minute, 32 seconds, as the rocket streaked downrange southeast over the Bay of Bengal. The first stage jettisoned and gave way to the second stage’s liquid-fueled Vikas engine at T+plus 1 minute, 51 seconds, for a firing that lasted about two-and-a-half minutes with around 180,000 pounds of thrust. The rocket’s on-board computer transitioned to closed-loop guidance during the second stage burn, and the PSLV’s 10.5-foot-diameter (3.2-meter) payload fairing fell away from the launcher at T+plus 2 minutes, 38 seconds. The PSLV first headed east from the Indian space center, then turned south in a “dogleg” maneuver to avoid flying over Sri Lanka, accelerating to orbital velocity over the Indian Ocean. Once the Vikas second stage engine emptied its 42-metric ton (90,000-pound) supply of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, the PSLV’s third stage — another solid rocket motor — ignited around T+plus 4 minutes, 24 seconds, for nearly two minutes, then coasted until separating from the rocket’s fourth stage at around T+plus 8 minutes, 12 seconds. Dual thrusters on the PSLV’s fourth stage burned for nearly eight-and-a-half minutes to place the 104 satellites into orbit. Less than a minute after reaching orbit, the fourth stage released the Cartosat 2D environmental satellite — the mission’s primary payload — about 17-and-a-half minutes into the mission. Ten seconds later, two experimental Indian nanosatellites separated to test new types of sensors to observe Earth’s surface, atmosphere and the conditions in the harsh environment of space. Then came a carefully-choreographed deployment sequence for the remaining 101 payloads stowed inside 25 Dutch-built “QuadPacks” for the ride into orbit. The QuadPacks opened two at a time to eject their CubeSat passengers. Most of the CubeSats separated while the PSLV was flying over a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean between ground stations in Mauritius and Antarctica. Once the PSLV passed in range of the receiving antenna in Troll, Antarctica, launch controllers at the Satish Dhawan Space Center confirmed all 104 satellites separated as planned. Telemetry data beamed down from the PSLV’s fourth stage indicated it reached an orbit around 313 miles (504 kilometers) in altitude and tilted 97.5 degrees to the equator, a near-perfect injection. “My hearty congratulations to the entire ISRO team for the wonderful job they have done,” said S. Kiran Kumar, ISRO’s chairman, during post-launch remarks. The Dutch company Innovative Solutions in Space, which specializes in arranging rideshare launches for small spacecraft, arranged for the multi-satellite launch and produced the QuadPacks for the CubeSats in less than six months. The company secured rights with Indian authorities to add secondary payloads to the flight in August. The addition of more than 100 extra satellites required Indian engineers to ensure the rocket’s fourth stage could hold pointing, guaranteeing the CubeSats would not collide with each other after separation. “Our teams came up with very good solutions at the right moment,” said B. Jayakumar, the mission director at ISRO. “The first one was finding real estate for accommodating all of the satellites within the payload compartment.” Seattle-based Spaceflight Services purchased space for nine CubeSats in the QuadPacks — eight 10.1-pound (4.6-kilogram) Lemur commercial weather satellites owned by Spire Global of San Francisco and the BGUSat payload developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and Ben Gurion University. Most of the satellites launched Tuesday were owned by Planet, another San Francisco company that has already sent up more than 100 shoebox-sized miniature Earth observatories. Planet’s 88 spacecraft on the PSLV nearly doubled the number of satellites the company has launched since its founding in 2010. The majority of Planet’s orbiting camera platforms have been ejected from the International Space Station in orbits that do not fly over the entire globe, while the satellites that went up from India launched into polar orbit, enabling worldwide coverage. The small 10.3-pound (4.7-kilogram) CubeSats, nicknamed “Doves,” carry a sharp-eyed camera, extendable solar panels, and high-speed data transmitters to beam images to antennas around the world. Each “flock” of Planet satellites debuts upgraded technology, with the suite of spacecraft launching Wednesday named “Flock 3p.” “This is the fifteenth time Planet is launching Dove satellites; and it will be our biggest launch to date,” Planet wrote in an update on its website earlier this month. “Combined with the 12 satellites of Flock 2p operating in a similar orbit, this launch will enable Planet’s 100 satellite “line scanner” constellation of Doves. With our RapidEye satellites and Doves operating in other orbits, Planet will be imaging the entire Earth daily.” With the satellites sent up on Tuesday’s launch, Planet said it has 144 spacecraft in its current fleet, accounting for members that are no longer working. Planet’s satellites do not have the high resolution of larger, more expensive Earth observatories — like those owned and operated by DigitalGlobe — but their large numbers allow customers to refresh views of a specific location on the ground more often. The launch of 88 Dove satellites came less than two weeks after Planet announced the acquisition of Terra Bella from Google, which has a constellation of seven higher-resolution spacecraft capable of recording high-definition video during passes over ground targets. Spire’s Lemur craft carry GPS radio occultation antennas, using satellite navigation signals passed through Earth’s atmosphere to derive temperature and humidity profiles that can be fed into numerical forecast models. Spire’s satellites also track ships out of range of terrestrial receivers. With Tuesday’s launch, the company has put a total of 29 CubeSats into orbit, some of which have ended their missions. Spire won a $370,000 contract from NOAA in September to supply pilot data for the weather agency to determine the information’s usefulness. If the pilot program proves fruitful, NOAA could place an order for more weather data from Spire and other commercial satellite startups to supplement measurements from government-owned satellites. The other international payloads on Tuesday’s launch were four CubeSats for institutes and companies in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and Kazakhstan. The Piezo Electric Assisted Smart Satellite Structure, or PEASSS, project will validate a new class of composite structures and power systems for future space missions. Backed by European Union research and development funding, the PEASS mission will help “develop, manufacture, test and qualify ‘smart structures’ which combine composite panels, piezoelectric materials, and next-generation sensors, for autonomously improved pointing accuracy and power generation in space,” officials wrote on the mission website. “Smart structures will enable fine angle control, thermal and vibration compensation, improving all types of future Earth observations, such as environmental and planetary mapping, border and regional imaging,” according to mission officials. The 6.6-pound (3-kilogram) PEASSS spacecraft was developed by a consortium of Dutch companies and scientific institutes. The Swiss-headquartered company SpacePharma launched its first satellite Wednesday. Named DIDO 2, the 9.3-pound (4.2-kilogram) CubeSat is the first in a line of small spacecraft SpacePharma hopes to send into orbit hosting miniature microgravity research experiments. The student-built Al-Farabi 1 and Nayif 1 CubeSats from Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, are also heading to space on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. Al-Farabi 1 will test out a communications system, and Nayif 1 carries an amateur radio transponder. Meanwhile, the chief purpose of Tuesday’s mission was the launch of Cartosat 2D, the fourth in India’s latest line of mapping satellites fitted with black-and-white and color cameras. M. Annadurai, director of the ISRO Satellite Center, said after the launch that Cartosat 2D’s solar panels extended as planned following its separation from the PSLV. Ground teams were expected to switch on the satellite’s mapping cameras as soon as Feb. 18. The 1,574-pound (714-kilogram) Cartosat 2D spacecraft will help analysts update maps, plan urban and rural infrastructure, monitor coastlines and track water usage during its five-year mission. “This year’s first launch has turned out to be a remarkable event that will be inscribed in golden letters in the space history of India,” said P. Kunhi Krishnan, director of the Satish Dhawan Space Center. Email the author. Follow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.


*The article is adapted from Musk's presentation at the International Astronautical Congress and begins with an argument for why we should focus on Mars for our move towards interplanetary life. Musk then notes that with current technologies, a ticket to Mars would cost around $10 billion, which he correctly deduces is a prohibitive amount if we want to actually colonize another planet. Getting that cost down to the median price of a house -- around $200,000 -- is key to making the Mars plan viable, says Musk. And he outlines four essential steps that will need to be taken if there's any hope of doing that. First, the transportation would have to be fully reusable because any amount of waste would significantly increase the cost. And ships would need to be refilled while in orbit. Additionally, we would need to be able to produce propellant on Mars and it would have to be optimized for cost, reusability, and easy production -- Musk proposes methane. Musk then proceeds to detail the proposed engine, rocket booster and ship as well as how many ships we would need and how many people each one should be able to carry. For the crew compartment Musk says, "There will be movies, lecture halls, cabins, and a restaurant. It will be really fun to go. You are going to have a great time!" Musk sketches a rough timeline for these events, but keeps it purposefully vague. It's clear, however, that this is something he's actively working towards. The fifteen-page journal article is not quite what you expect to see in a peer-reviewed journal -- there are some humorously unnecessary venn diagrams and a few tables that are nothing more than bullet points. But it's a much more flushed out write-up than we usually get from Musk. To see the presentation the article is based on, check out the video below.


*Investigators have determined that the September incident was likely caused by super-cooled liquid oxygen building up in a "void or buckle" between a pressure vessel's aluminum liner and its carbon overwrap. If the oxygen gets trapped in a buckle, it can create friction that ignites the chemical and, well, the whole rocket. To make matters worse, the loading temperature of helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, which increases the odds of it getting stuck and producing friction. The stopgap solution is to change the pressure vessel configuration to allow warmer helium, and to return to a "proven" helium loading setup. In the long run, however, SpaceX is planning to redesign the vessels so that buckles aren't even possible. The timing of both the launch and the associated fixes is critical for the company. The 2016 explosion not only lost a valuable vehicle and its payload, but shook the trust for both clients and advocates of private space travel. Were Elon Musk and crew moving too quickly? SpaceX needs to show that it learned from its mistakes, and that catastrophic failures won't happen again for a long time, if ever.


*The company is no stranger to successful rocket landings -- they're considered routine at this point. With Falcon Heavy, however, there are challenges SpaceX just didn't have to face before. It has to separate and land the boosters in an elegant, coordinated fashion that avoids collisions and other erratic behavior. And of course, having three rockets increases the odds of failure. SpaceX has learned many lessons since it first unveiled plans for its heavy-duty rocket back in 2011, but this is a new chapter in its story. It has yet to know how well Falcon Heavy will fly in practice, and it isn't immune to problems even with years of experience under its belt.

*With every outlandish company announcement or tweet, Musk can come across as a visionary, swindler or master publicist. But regardless, he grabs news headlines, customers place down payments on products they might not see for months, and Tesla's valuation climbs higher. Musk's stories are irresistible, and a key reason is that he taps into the public's science fiction fantasies. For decades, sci-fi has shaped our very conception of what the future should be like. At a moment in which technology seems to be leading us toward a dystopia, Musk appears to be everyone's best shot at getting the future they've dreamt of. "They're buying into his futurist vision of completely untraversed worlds and ideas and opportunities that no one can see or think of, but when he describes them, you're inspired," said Americus Reed, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "That's why science fiction is attractive to us. It takes us out of our comfort zone and opens up our mind to an entirely new way of thinking, a new universe of all kinds of whimsical and even, in some cases, frightening possibilities." Reed studies the way that personal identity shapes purchasing behavior. In Musk's case, consumers feel like they're investing in their future selves by buying his products, matching who they are now with who they expect to be in a fantastical future. At the same time, they can vicariously become a little more like Musk, the visionary. Musk's name has become synonymous with -- if not bigger than -- his companies. To buy into SpaceX, Tesla or The Boring Company is to trust that Musk will make good on his vision of the future. Musk's appeal as entrepreneur and technologist is not about what he does but who he is. At different times, he's been compared to industrialist Henry Ford, fraudster P.T. Barnum, inventor Thomas Edison and literal superhero Tony Stark. He is not only trying to remold the entrenched industries of automotive, energy and interplanetary travel but also, as writer Neil Strauss points out, to disrupt our very relationship with distance and time. He is, essentially, a geek icon. "The decision to move from selling hats to flamethrowers to financing a massive tunnel-boring operation is such a preposterous proposition that it's hard not to be charmed by it," said Dan Casey, senior editor at Nerdist and host of Muskwatch, a weekly online video series covering exactly what it sounds like. "There is a cult of personality around Musk that you don't see with similar wealthy tech magnates, CEOs and entrepreneurs. Jeff Bezos may be wealthier, and Tim Cook sits on the throne of an empire of Apple products but they are straight-up boring compared to Musk." In an age in which all tech entrepreneurs promise they have the keys to the future, Musk also offers something else: a "meaningful worldview." This was the conclusion of Ashlee Vance, author of the biography Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future and a reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek. "Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants you to well save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation," Vance writes. Creating a sustainable ecosystem beyond our planet is Musk's organizing purpose, giving each of his projects an almost moral clarity. Consumer trust in Musk is important for more than publicity. His products and services come from the future: By nature, he's selling a dream that won't materialize anytime soon. Musk has a reputation for overestimating how many cars Tesla can produce, and the upcoming Falcon Heavy test flight was initially slated for last summer. Tesla loses money -- nearly half a million dollars per hour, reported Bloomberg in November -- and the country's onetime most valuable automaker is often referred to as an overvalued "story stock." Customers are funding the company too. Tesla has taken at least $400 million in deposits for the Model 3, the company's midrange sedan, even though production is behind schedule. "[Musk] appeals to the futurist in all of us, as we dream of what might be. And he's savvy enough to ask us to pay up front, thereby getting his customers to provide the funding for his dreams," said John Mullins, an associate professor of management practice at London Business School. This is why Musk needs a robust mythology: It not only raises capital from both his investors and individual consumers but also staves off the fear that his companies may be peddling vaporware. Perhaps when he sells trinkets like The Boring Company's flamethrowers and hats, it's also to remind us that his companies can produce tangible goods. While Musk's sci-fi indulgences could easily be interpreted as pure marketing stunts, Vance, the biographer who spent a year with Musk for his book, said the entrepreneur believes in his grand concepts. "There's no question to me that, at the heart of this, it is very genuine," Vance told Engadget. "Elon, you've got to remember, grew up as a rabid science fiction geek. He probably literally read every single science fiction book in his city, Pretoria, when he was growing up." "When he says, 'I want to go to Mars and create a multi-planetary species,' to me, there is no gimmick behind that at all. That is his honest-to-God driving principle of life. It's the only thing that really explains why he was willing to risk all of his money and his time and his marriages and time with his children to do all of this stuff." There is evidence that Musk is driven by more than riches. After his sale of PayPal to eBay, he took home about $180 million that promptly went into SpaceX, Tesla and renewable energy company SolarCity. In 2014, he announced Tesla would make all of its patents open source. Just last month, Musk said he would take no salary from Tesla for the next decade, only getting paid in shares if he hits wildly ambitious milestones (for living expenses, he borrows against his shares). For sure, Musk knows how to publicize his star power, particularly to his 18.4 million Twitter followers. Though disingenuousness on social media can be sniffed out in a second, Musk can come across online as funny, eccentric and intelligent. "He's got kind of like a wicked sense of humor that I don't think people always appreciate," Vance said. "There's no way Ford's CEO is going to sell flamethrowers to the public. He's on his own level." The real test of Musk's authenticity will be when his projects actually reach the market and evolve into something more than playthings for the rich. Right now, Falcon Heavy is set to launch in four days, and Tesla's Model 3 is already rolling out. With hope, we'll soon know if the future Musk has got us all dreaming about is the reality we've long desired -- or sheer fantasy. Images: SpaceX (Spacesuit, Mars colony layout)

*NASA Fires Up Thrusters on Voyager Spacecraft 13 Billion Miles Away NASA has nailed an engine test on a spacecraft 13 billion miles away. Last week, ground controllers sent commands to fire backup thrusters on Voyager 1, our most distant spacecraft. The thrusters had been idle for 37 years, since Voyager 1 flew past Saturn. To NASA's delight, the four dormant thrusters came alive. It took more than 19 hours -- the one-way travel time for signals -- for controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to get the good news. Engineers wanted to see if these alternate thrusters could point Voyager 1's antenna toward Earth, a job normally handled by a different set that's now degrading. The thrusters will take over pointing operations next month. The switch could extend Voyager 1's life by two to three years. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 is the only spacecraft traveling through interstellar space, the region beyond our solar system. Voyager 2 is close on its heels -- nearly 11 billion miles from Earth. The thruster test worked so well that NASA expects to try it on Voyager 2. That won't happen anytime soon, though, because Voyager 2's original thrusters are still working fine. The Voyager flight team dug up old records and studied the original software before tackling the test. As each milestone in the test was achieved, the excitement level grew, said propulsion engineer Todd Barber. "The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all," he said in a statement. The twin Voyagers provided stunning close-up views of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 also offered shots of Uranus and Neptune. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

*SpaceX's Elon Musk Talks Rockets, Moon Base and Colonization Elon Musk has unveiled plans for a new spacecraft that he says would allow his company SpaceX to colonize Mars, build a base on the moon, and allow commercial travel to anywhere on Earth in under an hour. The spacecraft is currently still codenamed the BFR (Big F***ing Rocket). Musk says the company hopes to have the first launch by 2022, and then have four flying to Mars by 2024. Last year Musk proposed an earlier plan for the spacecraft, but at the time had not developed a way of funding the project. Speaking at the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide Australia on Friday, Musk said the company had figured out a way to pay for the project. The key, he said, was to "cannibalize" all of SpaceX's other products. Instead of operating a number of smaller spacecrafts to deliver satellites into orbit and supply the International Space Station, Musk said the BFR would eventually be used to complete all of its missions. "If we can do that then all the resources that are used for Falcon9, Dragon and Heavy can by applied to this system," he said. SpaceX has been working feverishly on reusable spacecraft designs, now completing 16 successful landings in a row of its Falcon9 rocket. That was the key to allowing the ambitious design to be economic, he said. "It's really crazy that we build these sophisticated rockets and then crash them every time we fly," he said. "This is mad." Musk said the cost of fuel is low, and so if the crafts were fully reusable, the costs of flights drop dramatically. He said the company had already started building the system, with construction of the first ship to begin next year. "I feel fairly confident that we can complete the ship and be ready for a launch in five years," he said. By 2024, Musk said he wanted to fly four ships to Mars, two of which would have crew in them. By that stage, they planned to be able to build a plant on the surface of Mars that would be able to synthesize fuel for return journeys back from Mars. For a trip to Mars, he said the craft would be able to hold about 100 people in 40 cabins. But he said once the ship is built, it could be used to travel on Earth too. Musk did not estimate the cost of such flights, but said that most long-distance flights could be completed in 30 minutes, and you could get anywhere on Earth in under an hour. "If we're building this thing to go to the Moon and Mars then why not go to other places on earth as well," he said. He said the size of the payload -- which would allow items with a diameter of just under 9m -- means larger satellites could be delivered to orbit in a single mission. At a presentation at last year's International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, Musk described the earlier iteration of the system with more details about the costs. For that earlier version, he said the cost of sending a person on the SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System would be around $200,000. Musk suggested that multiple space rockets could take 100 people each over 40 to 100 years until a million people lived there. "It was much too big and fantastical," said Robert Zubrin, president and founder of Mars Society, a non-profit that promotes human settlement of Mars. Musk's proposal for getting a million people to Mars as quickly as possible was, Zubrin said, "like a D-Day landing." Instead, Musk should be thinking of sending just ten people to set up an agricultural base, Zubrin said. "Then send 20 more people and so forth to develop capabilities to make steel and eventually create institutions like schools." "He typically goes into something with over-reach," Zubrin added, referring to Musk's tendency to over-promise with many of his projects, including delivery dates of Teslas and the progress of The Boring Company, drilling a subterranean Los Angeles commuter tunnel. "But he's able to take criticism and adjust things to become achievable," said Zubrin. "If he reduces his launch system from 500 tons to 150 tons or less, that would show he's serious and would move him from the realm of vision to the realm of engineering." Lockheed Martin also presented an idea for a manned Mars mission at the Adelaide event. The aerospace company outlined a six-person space station called Mars Base Camp that it thinks could be orbiting the red planet by 2028 along with a lander that could descend to the surface. Astronauts on the space station could carry out scientific research and exploration work, including operating rovers and identifying landing spots on the surface of the planet for larger vehicles. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

*Model S Owner Steve Wozniak Harshes on Elon Musk and Tesla It's no shocker that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is wary of Elon Musk and Tesla -- he once said there is "way too much hype" around the company. At a conference in Sweden last week, Wozniak, who owns two Model S vehicles, doubled down on his Tesla criticism -- while still leaving an opening for future optimism. "Now, I don't believe anything Elon Musk or Tesla says," Wozniak said. "But I still love the ." In his talk about Tesla, Wozniak recounted one incident at Lake Tahoe, where his Tesla skidded off an icy road and fell into a snow bank, according to Business Insider, which reported on the Q&A with Wozniak. Despite the accident, Wozniak said he maintained his trust for Tesla, upgrading his model when Tesla introduced the feature that allows Tesla owners to "summon" their self-driving vehicles. He also bought into Musk's promise that the car would be able to drive itself across the United States by the end of 2016. But after Tesla broke up with the Israel company that developed sensors for Tesla and Musk's promise wasn't realized, his trust was damaged, said Wozniak. "I'm sure the next car will come out and Elon's promise will be that (this is the car that delivers)," said Wozniak, with author Seth Godin moderating the talk. Wozniak also took shots at the state of Tesla's current state of self-driving technology. He said longtime car manufacturers such as Audi and BMW are ahead of Tesla in the race for self-driving cars. © 2018 San Jose Mercury News under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

*SpaceX's Elon Musk Talks Rockets, Moon Base and Colonization Elon Musk has unveiled plans for a new spacecraft that he says would allow his company SpaceX to colonize Mars, build a base on the moon, and allow commercial travel to anywhere on Earth in under an hour. The spacecraft is currently still codenamed the BFR (Big F***ing Rocket). Musk says the company hopes to have the first launch by 2022, and then have four flying to Mars by 2024. Last year Musk proposed an earlier plan for the spacecraft, but at the time had not developed a way of funding the project. Speaking at the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide Australia on Friday, Musk said the company had figured out a way to pay for the project. The key, he said, was to "cannibalize" all of SpaceX's other products. Instead of operating a number of smaller spacecrafts to deliver satellites into orbit and supply the International Space Station, Musk said the BFR would eventually be used to complete all of its missions. "If we can do that then all the resources that are used for Falcon9, Dragon and Heavy can by applied to this system," he said. SpaceX has been working feverishly on reusable spacecraft designs, now completing 16 successful landings in a row of its Falcon9 rocket. That was the key to allowing the ambitious design to be economic, he said. "It's really crazy that we build these sophisticated rockets and then crash them every time we fly," he said. "This is mad." Musk said the cost of fuel is low, and so if the crafts were fully reusable, the costs of flights drop dramatically. He said the company had already started building the system, with construction of the first ship to begin next year. "I feel fairly confident that we can complete the ship and be ready for a launch in five years," he said. By 2024, Musk said he wanted to fly four ships to Mars, two of which would have crew in them. By that stage, they planned to be able to build a plant on the surface of Mars that would be able to synthesize fuel for return journeys back from Mars. For a trip to Mars, he said the craft would be able to hold about 100 people in 40 cabins. But he said once the ship is built, it could be used to travel on Earth too. Musk did not estimate the cost of such flights, but said that most long-distance flights could be completed in 30 minutes, and you could get anywhere on Earth in under an hour. "If we're building this thing to go to the Moon and Mars then why not go to other places on earth as well," he said. He said the size of the payload -- which would allow items with a diameter of just under 9m -- means larger satellites could be delivered to orbit in a single mission. At a presentation at last year's International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, Musk described the earlier iteration of the system with more details about the costs. For that earlier version, he said the cost of sending a person on the SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System would be around $200,000. Musk suggested that multiple space rockets could take 100 people each over 40 to 100 years until a million people lived there. "It was much too big and fantastical," said Robert Zubrin, president and founder of Mars Society, a non-profit that promotes human settlement of Mars. Musk's proposal for getting a million people to Mars as quickly as possible was, Zubrin said, "like a D-Day landing." Instead, Musk should be thinking of sending just ten people to set up an agricultural base, Zubrin said. "Then send 20 more people and so forth to develop capabilities to make steel and eventually create institutions like schools." "He typically goes into something with over-reach," Zubrin added, referring to Musk's tendency to over-promise with many of his projects, including delivery dates of Teslas and the progress of The Boring Company, drilling a subterranean Los Angeles commuter tunnel. "But he's able to take criticism and adjust things to become achievable," said Zubrin. "If he reduces his launch system from 500 tons to 150 tons or less, that would show he's serious and would move him from the realm of vision to the realm of engineering." Lockheed Martin also presented an idea for a manned Mars mission at the Adelaide event. The aerospace company outlined a six-person space station called Mars Base Camp that it thinks could be orbiting the red planet by 2028 along with a lander that could descend to the surface. Astronauts on the space station could carry out scientific research and exploration work, including operating rovers and identifying landing spots on the surface of the planet for larger vehicles. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

*NASA Fires Up Thrusters on Voyager Spacecraft 13 Billion Miles Away NASA has nailed an engine test on a spacecraft 13 billion miles away. Last week, ground controllers sent commands to fire backup thrusters on Voyager 1, our most distant spacecraft. The thrusters had been idle for 37 years, since Voyager 1 flew past Saturn. To NASA's delight, the four dormant thrusters came alive. It took more than 19 hours -- the one-way travel time for signals -- for controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to get the good news. Engineers wanted to see if these alternate thrusters could point Voyager 1's antenna toward Earth, a job normally handled by a different set that's now degrading. The thrusters will take over pointing operations next month. The switch could extend Voyager 1's life by two to three years. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 is the only spacecraft traveling through interstellar space, the region beyond our solar system. Voyager 2 is close on its heels -- nearly 11 billion miles from Earth. The thruster test worked so well that NASA expects to try it on Voyager 2. That won't happen anytime soon, though, because Voyager 2's original thrusters are still working fine. The Voyager flight team dug up old records and studied the original software before tackling the test. As each milestone in the test was achieved, the excitement level grew, said propulsion engineer Todd Barber. "The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all," he said in a statement. The twin Voyagers provided stunning close-up views of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 also offered shots of Uranus and Neptune. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

*Red Planet-Ready? Musk Vows SpaceX Trip to Mars The fact that Elon Musk wants to go to Mars is no secret. After all, he has said he thinks it will be possible to establish colonies of settlers on the Red Planet in the future. However, in order to reach that celestial goal, Musk also knows that a lot of things have to break in the right direction. The first of those is an actual rocket capable of launching humans on the approximately 35-million-mile voyage from Earth to Mars. And Musk says we may not have to wait too much longer for the first of those rockets to get into action. During an surprise appearance at the South by Southwest Conference in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, Musk said his SpaceX company could launch its first rockets to Mars as soon as early 2019. And, as befitting Musk's assertions that the rockets need to be reusable, he also said the spaceships would not only go to Mars, but make a return trip back to Earth. "I think we'll be able to do short flights, sort of up-and-down flights, probably some time in the first half of next year," Musk said during his appearance. The SpaceX rocket, which is going by the code name "BFR," will be so big that it will have double the liftoff thrust of NASA's famous Saturn V rocket, which sent astronauts to the Moon during the Apollo program. The last manned mission to the Moon was Apollo 17, in 1972. Musk has said he believes SpaceX rockets will be able to start taking people to Mars by 2024. © 2018 San Jose Mercury News under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

*All or Nothing? Big Pay Package and Big Goals for Tesla's Elon Musk Elon Musk will remain at Tesla Inc. under a 10-year, all-or-nothing pay package that demands massive growth. The agreement, revealed Tuesday in a regulatory filing, requires that Tesla grow in $50 billion leaps, to a staggering $650 billion market capitalization. To put those demands in perspective, the electric maker, based in Palo Alto, California, is worth less than $60 billion today. Tesla must hit a series of escalating revenue and adjusted profit targets, only after which Musk [seen here] would vest stock options worth 1 percent of company shares. He would get no other guaranteed compensation including salary, bonuses or equity "that vests simply by the passage of time," Tesla said. The pay still needs the approval of Tesla shareholders, who will vote on it at a special meeting in late March. Elon and Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, will recuse themselves from the vote. If the goals are reached, Tesla would be one of the biggest companies in America, and Musk's wealth would grow exponentially. The $650 billion benchmark would make Tesla the fourth-most valuable U.S. company, behind only Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. based on current valuations. It would be larger than Microsoft Corp., and would exceed the current combined valuation of the world's top eight publicly-traded auto companies. Tesla's plan to meet those goals was laid out in 2016 in a document Musk called "Master Plan, Part Deux." Tesla will expand from electric cars and SUVs to trucks -- including a semi tractor-trailer that's due out in 2019 -- and buses. It will continue to work on autonomous vehicle technology and plans to enter the car-sharing business, letting owners share their cars when they're not using them and running Tesla-owned fleets in cities. The company, which bought solar panel maker SolarCity Corp. in 2016, also plans to expand its solar panel and energy storage businesses. In order to vest shares when milestones are reached, Musk must stay on as CEO or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer. That would give Tesla the option of hiring a different CEO in the future. Tesla said while it doesn't currently intend for Musk to step away from the CEO role, the terms allow Musk to potentially focus more of his attention on key product and strategic matters. Musk is also the founder and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX and the co-founder and chairman of OpenAI, a nonprofit that researches artificial intelligence. He was also the founder of the online payment service PayPal. Musk has worked under similar all-or-nothing conditions before. Under a 2012 agreement, Musk's stock options vested only if the Tesla's market cap continued to rise in $4 billion increments. The company also had to hit matching operational milestones, including vehicle production targets and developmental milestones tied to the Model X and Model 3 programs. Tesla wound up reaching all of the market cap milestones and nine of the 10 operational milestones. When that pay package was created, the company was worth just $3.2 billion. Its market cap at the end of last year was 17 times that amount. Tesla -- which turns 15 this year -- has never earned a full-year profit. It has reported only two profitable quarters since it went public in 2010. Each of the four vehicles it has made has faced significant delays and production problems. Its newest vehicle, the lower-cost Model 3 sedan, is no exception. Musk said last summer that Tesla would be making 20,000 Model 3s per month by the end of last year, but Tesla made just 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. Musk now says Tesla will make 20,000 Model 3s per month at the end of the second quarter. But that hasn't dimmed investors' appetite for Tesla's stock. Tesla shares were up 1 percent to $355 in morning trading. They've risen 39 percent over the last year. © 2018 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

*WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- SpaceX rockets may return to flight as early as Sunday, according to the company. The news comes following an in-depth investigation into the explosion of a rocket from SpaceX's September mission. The company said in a statement Monday the botched launch was due to a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank. The vessel buckled, causing liquid oxygen to accumulate. It believes this led to friction, sparks and the explosion. SpaceX conducted the investigation along with officials from NASA, the Federal Aviation Authority, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board. The Federal Aviation Administration will have to sign off on the report and issue SpaceX a license to launch. SpaceX appears optimistic it will be launching rockets again soon. To prevent such an incident from happening again, SpaceX will now load its rockets with warmer helium and revert to its older, proven method of loading helium. Down the road, it plans to change the design of its pressure vessels. SpaceX originally intended to return to space by November. Shortly after the investigation begin, CEO Elon Musk called it the most difficult and complex failure of the company's 14-year existence. The company has drawn praise for its low-cost rockets and wowed spectators by landing rockets on a platform at sea. However, the company has also been dogged by mishaps, such as this fall's explosion. SpaceX holds a NASA contact to carry U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station, but for now, it plans to catch up on delayed launches.

*Well, that was fast. Elon Musk claims to have sold out of flamethrowers in just four days. The Tesla founder said on Twitter that he would stop taking orders for the $500 devices after selling 20,000. The goal was to raise $10 million for his tunneling business, The Boring Company. The Boring Company, founded in 2016, has plans to create a network of underground tunnels to ease traffic congestion. Musk, who is known for provocative antics, first mentioned plans to sell a flamethrower in December, and repeatedly plugged the idea on social media. The Boring Company insisted the flamethrower is safe. "Much like a roller coaster, this is designed to be thrilling without danger," a company spokesman said in a statement. Musk had advertised the flamethrowers as "guaranteed to liven up any party," drawing a huge reaction online. "When the zombie apocalypse happens, you'll be glad you bought a flamethrower," he tweeted on Sunday. "Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!" Related: Can Elon Musk make subway tunnels cool again? The flamethrowers will start shipping in the spring, according to The Boring Company's website. Musk said in a tweet that each flamethrower would be dispatched with a complimentary fire extinguisher. The Boring Company previously sold 50,000 hats for $20 apiece in 2017. The business is privately funded. Related: Tesla won't pay Elon Musk unless Not everyone is amused. Miguel Santiago, who serves in the California State Assembly, said he would file legislation to block the stunt. "We've now seen some of the worst wildfires in California's history, so handing out flame torchers for $500 is a really bad idea and bad public policy," he said. -- Julia Horowitz and Bill Burke contributed to this report.

*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (WESH) — For the first time, SpaceX officials are talking in detail about the launch pad that was damaged in a huge rocket explosion last year. The pad is back in business, and the launch next week will include some firsts. People can get within miles of launch pad 40 at the Cape, and SpaceX, which rents the pad from the Air Force, still won’t release a picture of it. But it surely looks different from the way it was Sept. 1, 2016. During a prelaunch engine test, a fully fueled SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded when a helium tank inside the rocket ruptured. “After we kind of dusted off ourselves after the accident, we really looked at this as an opportunity to not only rebuild the pad, but make it better,” said John F. Muratore, director of launch operations for Launch Complex 39A at SpaceX. One of the big improvements is a stronger system to lift the rocket to vertical; now it takes five minutes instead of 30. SpaceX engineers say the pad is safer, too, and more efficient. It can now host a rocket launch once a week, if needed. The next launch is Tuesday, and it’ll be the first time the company launches a reused rocket paired with a reused cargo ship. The cargo ship will take supplies to the space station on its second visit there. And if the same thing happens again? “We mapped out, after the accident, where every piece of hardware went, and where all the damage was. And we’ve moved as much equipment as possible out beyond that boundary,” Muratore said. The world will get a better look at the rebuilt pad during the launch Tuesday.

*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) – SpaceX is about to launch a few tons of research to the International Space Station – plus ice cream. An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to blast off at 12:31 p.m. Monday from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo. That includes 20 mice. The Dragon capsule is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream for the station’s crew of six, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. As usual on these cargo flights, SpaceX will try to land its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral. STORIES OTHERS ARE CLICKING ON- >> BACK TO TOP STORIES


*The dog days of summer are here, so shouldn’t astronauts hurtling through space get to enjoy some Earthly delights? Today, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch some experiments—and lots of ice cream—up to astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Honestly, the flavour selection is not too shabby. Today’s delivery of tasty treats should not be confused with The Cosmic Ray Energetics and Mass (CREAM) experiment—or ISS CREAM—an iteration of which will also be ferried up into Low Earth Orbit today. ISS CREAM is kind of like a balloon that measures cosmic rays in space, far above the interference of Earth’s atmosphere. Its cute name might also have something to do with today’s special delivery, of actual ice cream. “There will be chocolate, vanilla and birthday cake flavoured ice cream heading to the International Space Station on today’s launch, as well as ice cream candy bars,” Kathryn Hambleton, Public Affairs Officer at NASA Headquarters, told Gizmodo. “[The ice cream] is frozen. It will be going up in three freezers that will come back filled with research when Dragon returns.” SpaceX’s ice cream run—whose launch window opened at 16:31 GMT from Kennedy Space Center in Florida—includes roughly 2,900 kg of science experiments and supplies packed into a Dragon spacecraft. This includes 20 mice, which will be used to study the impacts of long duration spaceflight on biology. It’s the rocket company’s 12th contracted resupply run to the ISS, and between ice cream, mice, and an attempted re-landing of the Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage booster, it should be one hell of a launch.

*Several All Blacks players paid a special visit to children and their whānau at Starship Hospital in Auckland. The members were invited by ASB to help celebrate the 2017 DHL New Zealand Lions Series. The Starship Foundation is the official charity of the series. The All Blacks visited wards, played coin rugby and connect four with children and passed around the ASB donation ball. ASB head of community and sponsorship Mark Graham says ASB was delighted to bring 10 All Blacks to Starship on Wednesday. “We’re thrilled to celebrate our 25-year partnership with the Starship Foundation this year by being involved in the Lions series together. The visit was all about bringing the tour to Starship children and their families. It was a fun morning and great to see the delight on kids’ faces as they played games with the All Blacks,” Mr Graham says. The All Blacks who visited Starship were: Joe Locke, Ryan Crotty, Israel Dagg, Owen Franks, Jack Goodhue, Ngani Laumape, Liam Squire, Codie Taylor, Matt Todd, Ofa Tu’ungafasi and Aaron Smith.


*By MARCIA DUNNAP Aerospace Writer CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - A SpaceX capsule rocketed to the International Space Station on Monday, carrying tons of science research, plus ice cream. As has become customary on these cargo flights, SpaceX landed its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral shortly after liftoff, a key to its long-term effort to recycle rockets and reduce costs. It was the 14th successful booster landing for SpaceX and the sixth on the giant X at the company's touchdown spot at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just a few miles from its NASA-leased pad at Kennedy Space Center. "X marks the spot for yet another picture-perfect landing," announced SpaceX Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo, which should reach the orbiting lab Wednesday. That includes 20 mice that will return alive inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule in about a month. The Dragon is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. She's due back at the beginning of September. Newly arrived U.S. spaceman Randolph Bresnik turns 50 next month. The space station was zooming 250 miles above the Atlantic, just off Nova Scotia, when the Falcon took flight. The mice are part of a study of visual problems suffered in space by some male astronauts. Scientists will study the pressure in the animals' eyes, as well as the movement of fluid in their brains. Thirty days for mice in space is comparable to three years for humans, according to Florida State University Michael Delp, who's in charge of the experiment. The study may help explain why female astronauts don't have this vision problem, which can linger long after spaceflight, he added. The Dragon also holds an instrument to measure cosmic rays from the space station. This type of device has previously flown on high-altitude balloons. The Army has an imaging microsatellite on board for release this fall from the station. It's a technology demo; the military wants to see how small satellites like this, with low-cost, off-the-shelf cameras and telescopes, might support critical ground operations. It's about the size of a dormitory-room refrigerator. Also going up on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation: protein crystals that, in space, might shed light on Parkinson's disease. The mission got a televised plug from Fox, an actor who has the disease. Three Americans, one more than usual, and an Italian will tackle all this scientific work in orbit. The station also is home to two Russians; that number will go back up to three in a year or so. This is the 13th delivery by SpaceX, one of two private shippers hired by NASA. The other is Orbital ATK; its next supply run is in November from Wallops Island, Virginia. The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items to Earth. It parachutes into the Pacific; the others burn up during re-entry. This particular Dragon is brand new, as is the Falcon rocket. In June, SpaceX launched its first reused Dragon, and in March, its first reused Falcon. From now on, the company said it may only fly used Dragons. SpaceX is also developing a crew Dragon for NASA astronauts, set to debut next year. Boeing is working on its own capsule to ferry space station astronauts. In the meantime, SpaceX is aiming for a November debut of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which will feature three first-stage boosters and 27 engines, versus the single booster and nine engines on the Falcon 9. It will have two-thirds the thrust of NASA's Saturn V rocket, which was used during the Apollo moon program. All three of the Falcon Heavy's first-stage boosters are meant to fly back to a touchdown. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

*Why it matters to you Elon Musk could be about to get the opportunity to show what Tesla's solar energy technology can do on a large scale. In the wake of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still without power. The island’s infrastructure was due for an upgrade even before the recent natural disaster, and now it seems that one of the biggest names in the technology industry might be taking on the mission to make that happen. SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has already sent hundreds of its Powerwall batteries to Puerto Rico as a stopgap. On Thursday, October 5, he took to Twitter to state that his company has the means to provide the necessary support to rebuild its power grid. “The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” tweeted Musk. He went on to stress that the company would need the blessing of the Puerto Rican government, the Public Utility Commission, any commercial stakeholders, and the island’s residents. Puerto Rico’s governor Ricardo Rossello responded to Musk just hours later, according to a report from the Huffington Post. He suggested that the island could be a “flagship project” for Tesla’s technology, giving the company an opportunity to demonstrate just how effective its methods of harvesting and storing solar power can be. Last year, Tesla subsidiary SolarCity led a project that installed a microgrid system on the island of Ta’u in American Samoa. As a result, the company stated that almost 100 percent of its power needs would be catered to by renewable energy. This new technology obviously has some major benefits from an environmental perspective. It’s also much more reliable, and would likely be more resilient when future storms roll in — not to mention cheaper to run than the current system, which relies on imported oil. There are big questions to be asked about the timescale of the project, as there is a pressing need to return power to residents. It took a year to install the microgrid system on Ta’u, an island that spans just 17 square miles. Puerto Rico is much larger, at 3,515 square miles. Musk is confident that scalability won’t be an issue, but for residents of Puerto Rico, such a dramatic overhaul of the power infrastructure might take too long to come to pass.


*Why it matters to you With its VR and AR pilot projects, NASA is set to make its space science and engineering programs even more immersive. Believer it or not, NASA astronauts have already visited Mars — in virtual reality. And they have been training in VR for years. Now the agency is exploring new ways to apply virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR) for scientists and engineers, from designing next-gen spacecraft to interpreting cosmic data. “Anyone who followed the popularity of Pokémon Go has seen how the public has embraced this technology,” Thomas Grubb, a NASA engineer, said in a statement. “Just as it’s changing the gaming industry, it will change the way we do our jobs. Five years from now, it’s going to be amazing.” Grubb and his team are developing six pilot projects to study the potential of these technologies for near- and long-term applications for scientists, technicians, and engineers. Last year was called the year VR goes from virtual to reality. The thing is, VR has been around for years. And although it became more prominent in 2016, VR seemed overshadowed by news about other emerging tech, like hobby drones, artificial intelligence, and 3D printing. NASA “For several years, commercial VR and AR technology has been showing promise, but without real tangible results,” said Ted Swanson, a senior technologist at NASA. “However, recently there have been substantial developments in VR/AR hardware and software that may allow us to use this technology for scientific and engineering applications.” Among the AR pilot projects, the team will test an app designed for technicians controlling robotic arms, like the one found on the International Space Station. The augmented app provides users with a camera view and telemetry data in a single interface. In another app, users get a 3D simulation of Goddard Space Flight Center’s thermal-vacuum chamber, so engineers can review whether spacecraft parts fit in the facility before undergoing testing. On the VR side, Grubb and his team are creating an app that allows users to design and construct spacecraft using off-the-shelf components and virtual tools. With these systems, workers from various locations can work together on a single project. “The collaborative capability is a major feature in VR,” Grubb said. “Even though they may work at locations hundreds of miles apart, engineers could work together to build and evaluate designs in real-time due to the shared virtual environment. Problems could be found earlier, which would save NASA time and money.” The teams will also be experimenting with VR and AR for interpreting scientific data. These will include a 3D simulation of terrestrial lava flows, a visualization of CubeSats orbiting and studying the Sun, and a simulation of Earth’s magnetosphere.


*In brief: Musk has officially announced his intentions to compete for a contract to build a high-speed loop in Chicago, through his venture The Boring Company. Not a hyperloop, this railway system will instead use electric pods. A BORING LOOP Surprise, surprise — Elon Musk has announced another major new project via Twitter. This time, Musk has revealed a project within his drilling venture, The Boring Company. The company, according to Musk, will “compete to fund, build & operate a high-speed Loop connecting Chicago O’Hare Airport to downtown.” The Boring Company will compete to fund, build & operate a high-speed Loop connecting Chicago O’Hare Airport to downtown https://t.co/bRqKpzSJjz — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 30, 2017 The goal of the new system, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, is to shuttle Chicago residents between downtown and O’Hare airport in less than 20 minutes — half the time of the current commute. Musk and his competitors for the Chicago contract will have to include both a downtown and airport station, as well as a maintenance facility, and have a plan in place to minimize “potential conflicts or impacts on existing transportation systems and the environment.” A part of the “O’Hare express project,” this concept has been a dream and goal of Chicago’s elected officials for many years. In fact, Chicago’s former Mayor, Richard M. Daley, tried to convince Chinese investors to build the railway system stemming from the Block 37 super-station. But until now, this concept has remained an ambitious, lofty hope — right up Elon Musk’s alley. A NON-HYPER LOOP The Sun-Times notes that top mayoral aides took a trip to Los Angeles earlier this year, to discuss the hyperloop option with Musk. Current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanual has expressed enthusiasm over hyperloop technology, and previously said that Musk was “very interested.” However, Musk has clarified that the Chicago system would not actually be a hyperloop. He explained the distinction on Twitter, saying that “A Loop is like a Hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube. Don’t need to get rid of air friction for short routes.” Can you clarify what's a "high-speed loop"? I assume we are not talking hyperloop? Is it the previously unveiled electric skate concept? — Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) November 30, 2017 Instead of the vacuum-pods that are part of Hyperloop’s signature, this venture will instead use electric pods to transport people. There are very few details about the current status of this venture, but we hope to soon learn more about the future of high-speed, public transport in Chicago.

*Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk speaks on April 30, 2015 in in Hawthorne, California. Ringo H.W. Chiu / AP How can humans stay relevant in an age of artificial intelligence? Elon Musk thinks cyborgs are the answer. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO discussed the need for a "merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence" during a talk on Monday at the World Government Summit in Dubai, CNBC reported. One of the main advantages computers have over humans is the speed at which they can send out information, Musk said. While humans are limited by the the speed of their typing, a computer can send out information at "a trillion bits per second," Musk said. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more advanced, humans will also need to evolve to remain relevant, he added. Related: Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures "Some high-bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence, and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem," Musk said of the need for humans to merge their minds with computers, according to CNBC. Musk has previously discussed a system that could link human brains to a computer interface. This so-called "neural lace" concept, which would add a digital layer of intelligence to the human brain, was first mentioned at Recode's Code Conference last year. Since introducing the idea, Musk has hinted at the interface's progress and has further discussed his views on an artificially intelligent future. Musk has also expressed his fear of "deep AI," explaining that an artificial general intelligence would be "smarter than the smartest human on Earth." Though this technology is not an immediate threat, Musk said the combination of human brains with machine intelligence will ensure humanity's continued relevance. Related: How Computers are Learning to Predict the Future However, one aspect of AI that is an immediate threat is the displacement of jobs, Musk said. During the World Government Summit talk, Musk specifically noted that with autonomous cars, an industry in which Tesla is a leader, AI will displace people in driving-focused positions such as truck drivers, delivery drivers and taxi drivers. "The most near-term impact from a technology standpoint is autonomous cars," Musk said at the Summit, according to CNBC. "But there are many people whose jobs are to drive. In fact, I think it might be the single largest employer of people driving in various forms." Musk estimated that 12 to 15 percent of the global workforce will be out of a job once autonomous vehicles AI take over driving duties, CNBC reported. Original article on Live Science.

*Elon Musk is getting into the roasted chestnut business with a flamethrower that looks like a futuristic weapon. The Silicon Valley CEO said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was “A-ok” with its sale so long as the torch is less than 10 feet. But an ATF spokeswoman told NBC News on Monday that it doesn’t regulate flamethrowers. The Boring Company's Flamethrower The Boring Company "I'm not sure why he said that,” said the spokeswoman, Alexandria A. Corneiro. “The domestic production and possession [of flamethrowers] are not regulated by the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act, so we have no regulatory function in that matter.” Corneiro wasn’t sure who regulates flamethrowers. The Boring Company, which Musk founded in 2016 and began taking pre-orders for the torches on Saturday, did not immediately respond to requests for clarification. The company had taken orders for 10,000 of them at $500 a pop as of Monday afternoon, Musk claimed on Twitter. Elon Musk Tim Rue / Bloomberg via Getty Images file But in California, where Musk's company is headquartered, state assemblyman Miguel Santiago, D-Los Angeles, said that he planned to block their sale. Referring to the Boring Company, which has proposed building a vast network of tunnels to alleviate traffic congestion in densely populated sections of the United States, including in Los Angeles, Santiago said that the company’s “deviation” from a “real public policy problem…feels like a complete slap in the face.” Related: Tesla denies Model 3 production snags, but says certain parts are being hand built "If this is real, I’m outraged and you should be too," Santiago wrote on Twitter. "If this is a joke, then it’s a terribly insensitive one given that we’re coming off of the worst wildfire season in history. Either way: NOT FUNNY. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. In announcing the device, Musk wrote on Instagram that “a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one. Unless you want to have fun.” In a video that accompanied the post, Musk can be seen turning the machine on. As an intense blue flame erupts from the barrel, he grins and runs toward the camera. “Fire extinguisher sold separately (for exorbitant amounts of money),” the company says on its website. “May not be used on Boring Company decorative lacquered hay bales or Boring Company dockside munitions warehouses.” Musk made the comment about the ATF after a would-be purchaser wrote on Twitter that the flamethrowers might be illegal. “ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok,” he said. “Our design is max fun for least danger. I’d be way more scared of a steak knife.”


*Get the Mach newsletter. SUBSCRIBE Elon Musk first described his idea for a futuristic transportation system that would send passenger pods through tubes at speeds of hundreds of miles an hour back in 2013. At the time, the idea of actually building and operating a so-called “hyperloop” seemed far-fetched, to say the least. But hyperloops are no longer quite so hypothetical. A handful of firms are now competing to develop the necessary technology. And in addition to designing the magnetically levitated pods and testing them on small-scale tracks, the firms are taking preliminary steps to set up hyperloop routes in the U.S. and abroad. “It’s happening far faster than I would have ever expected, and it’s happening all over the world,” said Dr. David Goldsmith, a transportation researcher at Virginia Tech. One of the biggest players is Musk himself. His whimsically named Boring Company is planning to dig a hyperloop tunnel that would make it possible to travel from Washington, D.C. to New York City in half an hour (the fastest Amtrak trains make the trip in just under three hours). Meanwhile, a pair of California-based startups, Virgin Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, are developing routes in North America, Asia, and Europe. An electric skate will carry between 8 and 16 passengers. Boring Company Many engineering and regulatory hurdles must be crossed before the first paying customer boards a hyperloop pod and zooms off down a tube — and not everyone shares Goldsmith’s rosy outlook. “I wouldn’t plan to take your next vacation on them,” Juan Matute, associate director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UCLA, said of the pods. “It’s going to take a lot of time to get implemented, if they ever are.” But with roads in many areas badly congested and air travel subject to weather delays, high-speed tube travel sounds appealing to many. In addition to shaving hours off of intercity trips, hyperloops promise to be less polluting than planes and cars. And hyperloop travel could even transform the morning commute, potentially allowing workers to travel comfortably to worksites hundreds of miles away from their homes. The hyperloop experience Hyperloop routes would consist of steel tubes roughly 11 feet in diameter that would be positioned on the ground or, in Musk’s vision, in underground tunnels. Either way, the routes would have to be picked carefully both to avoid existing infrastructure like roads and buildings and to make sure the routes take no sharp turns that could subject passengers to unpleasant jolts.

In Twitter and Instagram statements late Thursday (July 27), Musk announced the fall target for the Falcon Heavy's maiden flight. "Falcon Heavy maiden launch this November," Musk wrote on Twitter. He did not reveal a specific target date for the launch, though it is expected to fly from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX leases the pad from NASA and has been using it for Falcon 9 rocket launches. Related: SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Rocket in Pictures SpaceX's Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift rocket that will stand 230 feet tall (70 meters) and be capable of lofting payloads of up to 60 tons (54 metric tons) into low-Earth orbit, and up to 24 tons (22 metric tons) into a geostationary transfer orbit. The rocket will be the most powerful U.S.-built rocket since NASA's Apollo-era Saturn V moon rocket, SpaceX representatives have said. The Falcon Heavy is based on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and uses two Falcon 9 first stages strapped to a central core (itself a modified Falcon 9 booster). Like the Falcon 9, which can launch into orbit and land its first stage back on Earth for later reflight, the Falcon Heavy is designed to be reusable. Earlier this month, Musk dampened expectations for the Falcon Heavy's first launch. Speaking July 19 at the International Space Station Research and Development conference in Washington, D.C., Musk said there was a "real good chance" the Falcon Heavy wouldn't make it to orbit. "I hope it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage. I would consider even that a win, to be honest," Musk said during the conference. Related: So You Want to Be a Space Tourist? Here Are Your Options Earlier this year on March 30, Musk said the first Falcon Heavy will use two previously flown Falcon 9 first stages. SpaceX test fired the first Falcon Heavy core stage in May. Musk added on July 19 that designing the rocket was much more difficult than he expected, but he is confident that it will eventually prove to be "a great vehicle," despite any early hurdles with the first test flight. And the first test flight should be something to see, he said. "I encourage people to come down to the Cape to see the first Falcon Heavy mission," Musk said, referring to Cape Canaveral.

*In brief: Musk has officially announced his intentions to compete for a contract to build a high-speed loop in Chicago, through his venture The Boring Company. Not a hyperloop, this railway system will instead use electric pods. A BORING LOOP Surprise, surprise — Elon Musk has announced another major new project via Twitter. This time, Musk has revealed a project within his drilling venture, The Boring Company. The company, according to Musk, will “compete to fund, build & operate a high-speed Loop connecting Chicago O’Hare Airport to downtown.” The Boring Company will compete to fund, build & operate a high-speed Loop connecting Chicago O’Hare Airport to downtown https://t.co/bRqKpzSJjz — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 30, 2017 The goal of the new system, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, is to shuttle Chicago residents between downtown and O’Hare airport in less than 20 minutes — half the time of the current commute. Musk and his competitors for the Chicago contract will have to include both a downtown and airport station, as well as a maintenance facility, and have a plan in place to minimize “potential conflicts or impacts on existing transportation systems and the environment.” A part of the “O’Hare express project,” this concept has been a dream and goal of Chicago’s elected officials for many years. In fact, Chicago’s former Mayor, Richard M. Daley, tried to convince Chinese investors to build the railway system stemming from the Block 37 super-station. But until now, this concept has remained an ambitious, lofty hope — right up Elon Musk’s alley. A NON-HYPER LOOP The Sun-Times notes that top mayoral aides took a trip to Los Angeles earlier this year, to discuss the hyperloop option with Musk. Current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanual has expressed enthusiasm over hyperloop technology, and previously said that Musk was “very interested.” However, Musk has clarified that the Chicago system would not actually be a hyperloop. He explained the distinction on Twitter, saying that “A Loop is like a Hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube. Don’t need to get rid of air friction for short routes.” Can you clarify what's a "high-speed loop"? I assume we are not talking hyperloop? Is it the previously unveiled electric skate concept? — Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) November 30, 2017 Instead of the vacuum-pods that are part of Hyperloop’s signature, this venture will instead use electric pods to transport people. There are very few details about the current status of this venture, but we hope to soon learn more about the future of high-speed, public transport in Chicago.

*Those are just two of the highlights of the company's current Mars-colonization plan, which SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk unveiled early Friday morning EDT (Sept. 29) at the 68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Adelaide, Australia. Musk's talk — which took place Friday afternoon local Adelaide time — served to update the architecture the billionaire entrepreneur revealed at last year's IAC, in Guadalajara, Mexico. That previous presentation introduced a huge, reusable rocket-spaceship combo called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), which Musk envisioned helping to establish a million-person city on Mars within the next 50 to 100 years. [The BFR: SpaceX's Mars-Colonization Architecture in Images] As Musk described it last year, the roughly 40-foot-wide (12 meters) ITS booster would feature 42 Raptor engines. It would launch the spaceship to Earth orbit, then come back down to its pad for a pinpoint landing — and another flight in quick succession. The spaceship, meanwhile, would be fueled in orbit by a tanker (which would also be launched by an ITS booster). The ITS spaceships would linger in orbit until the time was right to depart for Mars, when they would do so en masse. (Such windows come along once every 26 months.) Each ship would be capable of carrying about 100 people to the Red Planet; after landing there and offloading their cargo and passengers, the ships would top up their tanks on the Martian surface with locally produced propellant (methane and oxygen) and then launch back to Earth. The new plan retains this same basic idea, but with some important tweaks. For example, the rocket has been scaled back a bit; it will now be about 30 feet (9 wide) and sport "just" 31 Raptor engines. (For comparison, the first stage of SpaceX's in-service Falcon 9 rocket has nine Merlin engines.) And the name "ITS" seems to be out: During Friday's talk, Musk repeatedly referred to the system by the "code name" BFR, which is short for Big F***ing Rocket. But the most important change has to do with the system's affordability, Musk said Friday. "In last year's presentation, we were really searching for what the right way — how do we pay for this thing?" he said. "We went through various ideas — do a Kickstarter, collecting underpants. These didn't pan out. But now we think we've got a way to do it." The answer, he explained, lies in downsizing the system a bit and using it for everything that SpaceX does, from satellite launches to International Space Station resupply flights to crewed Mars missions. In other words, the company plans to put its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets — the latter of which hasn't even flown yet — and its Dragon capsule out to pasture relatively soon. "If we can do that, then all the resources that are used for Falcon 9, Heavy and Dragon can be applied to this system. That's really fundamental," Musk said. "We believe that we can do this with the revenue we receive for launching satellites and for servicing the space station." SpaceX will, however, "build ahead" and keep a stock of Falcon 9s and Dragons around for a while, in case customers wish to use those vehicles during the early days of BFR operation, Musk added. Missions to Mars As currently envisioned, the BFR system (the ship stacked atop the rocket) will stand 348 feet (106 m) tall — about 50 feet (15 m) shorter than the ITS concept vehicle. The BFR booster will be capable of lofting 150 tons to low Earth orbit (LEO), making it more powerful than NASA's famous Saturn V moon rocket, which could launch 135 tons to LEO, Musk said. By itself, the BFR spaceship will stand 157.5 feet (48 meters) tall. It will feature 40 passenger cabins, each of which can theoretically fit five or six people but will more likely accommodate two to three, Musk said. So each ship will probably carry about 100 passengers on a typical Mars trip. The ships sport six Raptor engines, which should allow them to get to Mars after a deep-space journey of three to six months. The vehicles will land via supersonic retropropulsion, slowing their descent through the Martian atmosphere using thrusters, as Falcon 9 first stages do when they come back to Earth during orbital launches. SpaceX is currently riding a streak of 12 straight successful Falcon 9 landings, and that rocket's first stage touches down using just a single engine. The BFR spaceship will be able to land with the aid of either of its two central engines, Musk said. [In Photos: SpaceX Launches X-37B Space Plane, Lands Falcon 9 Rocket] "If you can get to a very high reliability with even a single engine, and then you can land with either of two engines, I think we can get to a landing reliability that is on par with the safest commercial airliners," he said. "So you can essentially count on the landing." The BFR system will also be airliner-like in its reusability; each booster and spaceship will fly again and again and again, helping make Mars colonization economically feasible, Musk said. "It's really crazy that we build these sophisticated rockets and then crash them every time we fly. This is mad," Musk said. "I can't emphasize [enough] how profound this is, and how important reusability is." SpaceX is now beginning "serious development" of the BFR system, he added. The company aims to launch at least two uncrewed ships to Mars in 2022, primarily to confirm the existence of necessary resources and set up infrastructure for future missions — power, mining and life support systems, for example.


*Though production launched last July at the company’s plant in Fremont, California, a series of snags have left Tesla struggling far short of expectations. After announcing worse-than-expected earnings last month, Musk recently insisted production is “absolutely on track” to reach target by mid-year. Sullivan is one of many skeptics. And even if the Tesla CEO is right, he notes that the company will be well behind on meeting the estimated 400,000 or so advance reservations for the Model 3, some potential buyers now likely not to take delivery until 2019 or beyond. Related: Is Tesla's Model 3 likely to sink the company? That is, of course, if they don’t ask for their $1,000 reservations back. And many appear to be doing just that, at least if Chevrolet dealers in some parts of the country are to be believed. They’ve been reporting that some potential Model 3 buyers have given up on waiting and are now buying Chevy’s own long-range electric, the Bolt EV. Giving credence to that claim, General Motors CEO Mary Barra this week announced that the automaker will be ramping up production of the Bolt — which beat the Model 3 to market by about six months. That said, Chevy’s expectations for Bolt are modest. Sales totaled just 26,000 last year. That was more than the Model 3, but if Tesla meets expectations, its compact electric sedan would generate sales of as much as 400,000 vehicles annually. GM itself plans to launch two more battery-electric vehicles by mid-2019, and 25 by 2023. Volkswagen will have 50 coming for its various brands, and even launch an all-new sub-brand called I.D. That includes a fully electric take on the classic VW Microbus, to be called the Buzz, as well as the big Vizzion sedan that debuted in Geneva this week.


*If it ever feels like you're wasting your life in traffic, that's not far off. The average American driver spends 42 hours a year in jams (about 9 percent of their total drive time), according to the traffic information company INRIX. In heavily congested cities like Los Angeles and New York City, that figure more than doubles. Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced his new venture, the Boring Company, which aims to solve our ever-increasing traffic problems by creating a complex network of subterranean tunnels for cars. The project will no-doubt be a marvel of engineering, but experts suggest that simpler alternatives may be preferable solutions to our traffic woes. Related: Elon Musk's Answer to LA Traffic Looks Like a Lot of Fun In Musk's vision, vehicles enter a citywide tunnel system on single-car electric “sleds” that lower cars from street level down into the buried network and then take off, carrying their loads at speeds of up to 125 mph. The project will start in LA but may spread to other cities if it's successful. By Musk's estimation, these sleds — which can automatically weave between various tunnels depending on the destination, where they're then lifted back to the surface — would take just five minutes to travel south from LA's Westwood Village to LAX airport, a 10-mile trip that would normally take 30 to 60 minutes in traffic. Current designs suggest a single mile of the tunnel could cost $1 billion. That tremendous price tag aside, the endeavor may not work as Musk hopes. The tunnels are the equivalent of adding extra lanes to roadways and would have the same results, says Hesham Rakha, director of the Center for Sustainable Mobility at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. That is, adding supply to your network inevitably creates so-called induced demand, in which drivers change their behaviors to make use of the increased network capacity. They'll take trips they wouldn't have otherwise taken, along routes they think are most favorable (in this case the tunnels). And unless there are large terminals or staging areas at the tunnel’s entry and exit points, you'd ultimately see a long line of cars awaiting their sleds and gridlock on streets where vehicles leave the underground network. 00:23 00:00 / 00:00 Elon Musk's Latest Venture Aims to Put an End to Traffic 00:00:55 So, while the Boring Company may alleviate traffic slightly, it's not a long-term solution, Rakha says. "People always try to minimize their own travel time but don't look at maximizing the utility of the entire system." That's not to say traffic congestion is an unsolvable issue. Rakha and other experts are proposing various alternatives — in particular, connected autonomous cars, efficient public transportation, and pricing methods like road tolls — that can help put an end to traffic. The challenge is figuring out what works best for a given city and how to implement these seemingly straightforward ideas. Smart Cars for Dumb Drivers Ending traffic requires understanding what causes it in the first place. Between vehicle accidents and lane closures, there are numerous reasons why traffic may build up on roads. But sometimes you find yourself in stop-and-go traffic that has no apparent cause; and then suddenly, after reaching an arbitrary point, the congestion eases up. Nearly a decade ago, Gábor Orosz, a mechanical engineer at the University of Michigan, found that these spontaneous jams are the result of "little ripples" of slowdowns that are amplified as they propagate backward along a chain of vehicles. There are two main factors involved, he says: Drivers have a slow reaction time of about 0.5 to 1.5 seconds and they're only reacting to the vehicle directly in front of them. Related: Self-Driving Cars Will Turn Intersections Into High-Speed Ballet In an ideal world, drivers would be nimble and attentive and be able to keep an eye on several cars ahead of them, allowing the driver to react to various scenarios with a light tap on their brakes. But instead, drivers often react late and must brake quickly to avoid accidents. This rapid deceleration forces the driver immediately behind them to slow down further, creating a cascading effect that creates a standstill several miles back. "When we have between approximately 20 to 40 cars per kilometer, we can get either a jam or get free-flow traffic," Orosz says. "And if we have higher densities [of cars], we almost always have jams because humans are not able to maintain uniform flow." The solution to this problem, Orosz suggests, is to remove human drivers from the equation. Today, almost all car companies (and tech giants like Google) are working on self-driving car projects, Orosz says. These vehicles sense the world and other cars through a combination of cameras, radar, sonar, and lidar (remote sensing with lasers). The cars can react more quickly to situations than human drivers, helping improve traffic conditions. But they’re still only reacting to vehicles in their immediate vicinity, Orosz says, adding that dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology fixes this limitation by allowing cars to "see" beyond their direct line of sight. This illustration shows how a connected automated vehicle (red) receives information from multiple vehicles up ahead. Gabor Orosz When equipped with DSRC radios, autonomous cars automatically broadcast their location, direction, and speed to one another over a specially allocated 5.9 GHz radio frequency band. When connected vehicles know what other DSRC-equipped vehicles are doing, they can travel in unison as highly efficient and dense vehicle "platoons." The U.S. Department of Transportation is seeking to require all new cars to have vehicle-to-vehicle communication starting around 2020 (only a handful of cars today have such technology built-in, none of which are autonomous). Though DSRC is a relatively cheap technology, fully autonomous cars probably won't be, so eliminating jams with these cars alone may not be feasible. However, reducing traffic jams doesn't require all cars on the road to be connected autonomous vehicles. "Making a few percent of these to be connected autonomous vehicles can result in a huge improvement in traffic conditions," Orosz says. Taking Cars Off the Road Connected autonomous vehicles are, like the Boring Company, a technological solution. But traffic congestion is a geometric problem and "technology never changes geometry," says public transit planning expert Jarrett Walker, author of "Human Transit." "A city is a place where people are close together and there isn't enough space per person," Walker says. "A car is an inefficient use of that space." The solution: fewer cars on the road. But how do you go about removing them? To solve traffic congestion, you need to understand that road space is governed by supply and demand, Walker explains. Simply put, reduce the demand for road use and you'll reduce traffic. Implementing road pricing, which can take various forms, is a great way to reduce demand for road use, Walker says. Tolls, for instance, are well-known tools to discourage people from driving on certain high-use roads, especially if the tolls are higher during peak hours. A sign reminds drivers of the congestion charge in London. Reuters But there are many ways to discourage driving. In cities like London, congested downtown areas could have fees for driving and for using select public parking spaces. Employees could be given cash incentives to give up their parking spots, encouraging them to take public transit or to carpool rather than drive to work alone. Fuel taxes could be increased, and drivers could be taxed based on the number of miles they drive in a year. Some cities, including Paris and Beijing, have taken an extreme approach that bans cars with even- or odd-numbered license plates from driving in city limits during specific days or times. "Road pricing is a free-market approach that's not particularly ideological," Walker says. "This is one of those issues where practically every transportation professional knows this is the answer, and the only reason we keep looking elsewhere is that, politically, we don't like it." A Holistic Approach Virginia Tech's Rakha agrees that reducing demand is a key component to solving traffic, but he says that increasing supply is also important. "You have to look at the system as a whole," he says, adding that focusing on one side of the equation will lead to a never-ending cycle of network adjustments and driver responses. "It's a chess game: When I make a move, my opponent will make a counter-move. You have to take that into account when you are doing some adjustment to your network, and think about the counter-move that drivers will make." People always try to minimize their own travel time but don't look at maximizing the utility of the entire system. Connected autonomous vehicles could be one tool used to increase supply, Rahka says. And for people who refrain from driving because of road pricing, efficient and reliable public transportation, such as trains, subways, and buses, is vital to making the system work. Walker doesn't advocate a specific public transportation technology but says the mode should be "protected" from traffic congestion — buses that drive on the same roads as cars are not ideal because they're still contributing to road use. The best public transportation technology also depends on the layout of the city. European cities are often condensed and centrally focused, so subways that can take many passengers from their homes to downtown areas work well. In many U.S. cities, however, people in the suburbs don't always live near transportation hubs. One solution for this problem is the "last mile," or programs that bring people between their homes and transportation hubs, such as bicycle-sharing programs and ride-sharing vans. Related: Driving on the Roads of the Future Will Be a Real Trip Overall, there are numerous tools that can help reduce traffic by reducing demand or increasing supply, but ending traffic congestion altogether is not so straight-forward. Whether city officials add tunnels underground, increase the number of smart cars on the road, or discourage people from driving, they need to model the system and simulate how different strategies will potentially affect traffic congestion. "Rather than trying to fix one bottleneck after another, you need to first evaluate different alternatives and try to capture how travelers are going to react before you implement them in the field," Rakha says. "Of course, any model has its flaws and there will be approximations and assumptions, but that's at least better than just building blindly." FOLLOW NBC MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.


*Space may be the final frontier, but it’s an expensive one to explore. There are ample problems with which to contend here on Earth, and that leads some people to wonder if space exploration is worth the hassle. At ExtremeTech, we believe the answer is unequivocally “yes.” Here are five reasons why space exploration is vital to humanity. New Technologies and Research Humans did not evolve to go into space, but we go there anyway. That has led to the development of various technologies that feed back into the economy and improve our lives on Earth. Without space programs, we wouldn’t have GPS, accurate weather prediction, solar cells, or the ultraviolet filters in sunglasses and cameras. There’s also medical research happening in space right now that could cure diseases and prolong human lives, and these experiments can’t be done on Earth. Space exploration could save your life. Asteroids and Comets Don’t Care About Us Speaking of saving lives, space exploration could save all our lives. Our solar system has calmed down a lot since the early eons, but there are still uncountable big asteroids and comets out there that could smack into the planet and really ruin your day. It’s happened several times in the past, each one causing a mass extinction. It’s not a matter of if another large asteroid hits Earth, but when. A robust space program is the only hope we have of deflecting such an object. Colonization Is the Ultimate Backup There are currently more than 7 billion humans, which is a lot. However, we’re all crammed together on this one planet. If something happened to Earth, our species could be wiped out. For example, the aforementioned asteroid impact. Colonizing other bodies in the solar system is a way to create a “backup” of humanity that will survive no matter what happens to Earth. Maybe future humans will be Martians who will never set foot on Earth. Space Mining Could Save the World As we develop new technologies on Earth, the strain on our natural resources continues to increase. The extraction of valuable minerals has led to a host of problems, including environmental damage and human exploitation, but there’s a wealth of precious materials in space. Startups like Planetary Resources want to mine asteroids instead of Earth, which would mean an effectively unlimited supply of raw materials that are rare on Earth. We Are Explorers There are more practical reasons for space exploration, but one of the principle reasons we must continue is that we’re explorers. That’s why humans number in the billions — from our earliest upright steps, we’ve endeavored to learn more about the world around us, and this allowed us to build civilization. Exploring space is an opportunity not only to discover new worlds and build advanced technologies, but to work together toward a larger goal irrespective of nationality, race, or gender. If we stop exploring, we stop being human.


*Over the past few years, SpaceX has demonstrated some impressive firsts once relegated to science fiction. The company has slashed the cost of orbital missions, even if the exact details of those savings are somewhat disputed. It developed and successfully landed a rocket, then successfully relaunched several rockets earlier this year. Now, Elon Musk is hoping his firm can set another record and successfully launch a used Dragon capsule sitting on top of a used Falcon 9. Musk announced the attempt on Instagram, writing: “On Tuesday, SpaceX will attempt to refly both an orbital rocket and spacecraft for the first time. These are pictures of the last mission each flew. Love the view of our Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station as it passes over the illumination boundary.” SpaceX has already launched used Falcon 9 and Dragon capsules in separate flights, but never simultaneously. If Musk can demonstrate that flying two used components can be as safe as flying one, he can bring the cost of future launches down by combining multiple recycled rockets (or pre-flown, if you prefer SpaceX’s term). Musk has claimed SpaceX’s re-usable rockets are $300M less expensive than conventional launches, and there’s no doubt the United Launch Alliance has taken a beating on price these last few years. Despite several rounds of layoffs and cost cutting, SpaceX’s launch costs are still estimated to be at least 40 percent less than the United Launch Alliance’s. The flip side to that, ULA would argue, is its own superior reliability record. ULA has never lost a rocket, while SpaceX has suffered several high-profile explosions. Despite these issues, it’s an exciting time for space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are driving innovation in the industry, debuting new capabilities, and (hopefully) setting the stage for manned Mars exploration. I don’t subscribe to the simplistic idea NASA failed at these goals because it was a government agency. Peruse the list of reasons why the Shuttle failed to meet its operational goals, cost-per-pound targets, and estimated flight costs, and you’ll find it was an incredibly complex problem. The Shuttle’s failure to meet its goals was thanks to at least a dozen variables that range from the limitations of 1970s technology to the Army’s demand for a much heavier vehicle, to an extremely expensive thermal tile system in which each tile had to be custom manufactured for its exact location on the Shuttle. An awful lot of people had their fingers in that particular pie, often in ways NASA had no control over. At the same time, however, there’s no denying the strength of commercial space launches. Congress loves the idea of NASA building a huge rocket (jobs!), but hates the idea of funding missions. The so-called Senate Launch System bill specified what components NASA would use in certain cases, to divert work to specific Congressional districts or states. SpaceX and Blue Origin are leading the charge to cut space launch costs in part because they aren’t saddled with the impossible task of building a rocket to nowhere with very little money.

*When Scott Stapf read a story about Puerto Rico’s “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink how it gets electricity,” he had a thought: Could Elon Musk rebuild the country’s electricity system with independent solar and battery systems? So, he posed the question on Twitter probably not expecting to get an answer from the man himself. But that’s exactly what he got: As Musk says in his tweet, Tesla is familiar with what it takes, though on a smaller scale than the one desperately needed in Puerto Rico. Check out this video of how it works on the Samoan island of Ta’u, from the SolarCity blog: Late Thursday, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricky Rossello expressed his interest, tweeting “Let’s talk” to Musk, saying “PR could be that flagship project.” Musk has already stepped up in a big way to do his part for Puerto Rico. After the hurricane left the island’s grid in shambles, Tesla reportedly sent hundreds of Powerwalls — battery systems designed to store energy — along with employees to install them in an effort to restore power. Musk also donated $250,000 of his own money to the relief effort. Tesla shares have gained 66 percent in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX has gained 14 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 15 percent.


*“He awoke — and wanted Mars.” That’s the first line of Philip K. Dick’s classic novella, “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,” the inspiration for the “Total Recall” films. I first came across the story in a sci-fi anthology back in high school, and I can remember the force of the yearning the words roused in me: I wanted Mars, too. After all, men had just walked on the moon, and everybody knew Mars would be next. Well, the moon landing will be celebrating its 50th anniversary in two years, and human beings haven’t even tried to walk anywhere else. So when Elon Musk announced last week that he hopes to send a manned mission to the red planet by 2022 — just five years from now — I felt my heart leap. The 1969 moon landing capped an era of enormous optimism about what humanity could achieve. Norman Borlaug was saving hundreds of millions from starvation. Integrated circuits heralded a digital revolution. The campy innocence of the original “Star Trek” dates from those years. So do “The Jetsons.” People actually believed that science was the endless frontier. Since then our species has turned its vision inward; our image of human possibility has grown cramped and pessimistic. We dream less of reaching the stars than of winning the next election; less of maturing as a species than of shunning those who are different; less of the blessings of an advanced technological tomorrow than of an apocalyptic future marked by a desperate struggle to survive. Maybe a focus on the possibility of reaching our nearest planetary neighbor will help change all that. see also Elon Musk shares plan to colonize Mars If there’s one thing you can definitively say about Elon Mars has long fascinated us. The ancients associated it with various gods. Venus shines brighter in the sky, but somehow we have always known that our destiny lies with Mars. Filmmakers have been taking us there for decades. The planet has intrigued novelists for well over 100 years. Ray Bradbury’s “The Martian Chronicles” may be dated in its science, but as social commentary on the 1940s, it stands unrivaled in the sci-fi canon. That’s all fiction. But maybe we’ll get there in reality. NASA has been pushing the idea for years. The agency’s current timeline would put humans on the planet in the 2030s. China intends to get there first. Musk claims he can beat them both. Every time someone proposes a mission to Mars, critics worry that the whole thing will be too expensive, that the money could be better spent elsewhere. Although I get their point, they’re only half right: The same complaint could easily be directed at every dollar we spend on rent or education or food. Besides, in Musk’s scheme the investment would come (mostly) from private sources. The point is to make the project self-sustaining. For those of us who dream of the stars, reaching Mars has always been a preliminary step. Musk agrees. His bolder plan is for humanity to advance along the path of becoming “a space-bearing civilization and a multi-planetary species” — an ambition he laid out this year in a thoughtful paper. Musk argues that what he calls the “Apollo-style approach” would make the cost of colonizing Mars prohibitive, something on the order of $10 billion a person. But people would move in droves, he insists, if the cost can be brought down to somewhere near the median price of a US home, around $200,000. Most of Musk’s paper is devoted to laying out a theory on how, over time, we might bring down the cost. For instance, he proposes establishing propellant depots throughout the solar system, potentially as far away as Pluto. The most important factor, however, is the development of multiple-use vehicles — the advance that made commercial air travel cost-effective. The booster rocket he describes in the paper is enormous. Musk has since decided that his original vision was impractical. He now wants to build a much smaller version that will carry perhaps 100 people at a time. He posted a series of images on Instagram to show both the vehicle he envisions and the Mars colony he imagines it would help populate. It’s a lovely and elegant idea. Can we do it? I have no idea. But Musk’s confidence rekindles in me the old excitement. Perhaps we need not be earthbound forever. Perhaps we as a species can once more look skyward with shared anticipation and excitement, confident that if we cannot reach the stars, our children will. So I hope we’ll try. I may not see Mars in my lifetime, but I’m thrilled you might see it in yours. © 2017, Bloomberg View


*The governor of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico — where more than 90 percent of the homes and businesses remain without power — wants Tesla chief and renewable energy guru Elon Musk to get the juice back on. “Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies?” Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted Thursday at Musk. “PR could be that flagship project.” Musk replied on Friday that he “would be happy to talk.” Rossello told reporters he expects to have a conversation with the Tesla chief executive officer, and said Puerto Rico needs to consider meeting its energy needs with more environmentally friendly technology. Musk himself prompted the conversation with a tweet earlier Thursday. “The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt. … and, most importantly, the people of PR,” Musk tweeted. “I fully support this!” Glorimar Ripoll, Puerto Rico’s chief innovation officer, chimed in a tweet replying to the governor’s post. “Let’s build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation #letstalk.” Tesla is already among a number of US companies sending rooftop panels and batteries to Puerto Rico, where more than 90 percent of homes and businesses remain without electricity more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria destroyed the grid, Bloomberg reported. The storms knocked out power to millions of utility customers who depend largely on fossil-fuel plants and long-distance transmission lines for service. Some in Puerto Rico may be in the dark for months as the grid is repaired. This isn’t the first time Musk has been approached via social media to demonstrate Tesla’s power-storage technology. Earlier this year, Musk wagered via Twitter that Tesla could install the world’s biggest battery project in Australia within 100 days, or else it would be free. He told reporters last week that the project was on track to meet the deadline. Tesla also completed a solar energy project on the island of Ta’u in American Samoa. Meanwhile, President Trump — who has commented several times on how much it will cost to rebuild the US territory — continued praising his administration’s relief efforts. “We love Puerto Rico. We’re doing great stuff there. We’re marshaling every federal resource at our disposal. We will not rest until that job is done,” he said at the White House during a celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month. With Bloomberg


*Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is preparing to resume rocket launches on Jan. 8, according to industry officials, using revised operational procedures developed in response to a fiery accident that occurred during routine ground preparations last fall. The tentative blastoff date for the Falcon 9 from North California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base is subject to results of testing later this week, these officials said, and still could change. But if everything checks out, they said, Iridium Communications Inc., IRDM, -4.00% which has been eagerly waiting to get the first 10 of its next-generation communications satellites into orbit since the September 2016 fireball, anticipates a launch next Sunday morning.

However, they say it is too early for definitive answers.

Musk & Co have said all Tesla vehicles produced since October 2016, including the $35,000 Model 3 sedan, contain “the hardware needed for full self-driving capability,” though such features aren’t currently enabled. That implies the vehicles are what the industry calls “Level 5” autonomous cars. “I think he’s full of crap,” said Miller, according to multiple reports. “To be what an SAE Level Five full autonomous system is, I don’t think he has the content to do that.” Miller said he did not believe full-autonomous driving could be implemented at the Model 3’s price point, according to a Sydney Morning Herald story. It’s “irresponsible” to say a car has fully autonomous capability at this point, GM’s director of autonomous vehicle integration added, according to an Australian article. “To be deeply integrated into Level Five, you should have some redundancies,” said Miller, whose slams came during a briefing to Aussie media in Detroit. “Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.” See: Driver in fatal Tesla crash previously had posted video of Autopilot saving him And: Tesla’s push on autonomous driving rankled its Autopilot team Tesla and GM are up 66% and 26% so far this year, respectively, while a broad auto industry ETF CARZ, +0.19% has gained 20%.

*Nearly a year before Roseanne Barr blamed “Ambien tweeting” for a racist post that led to the cancellation of her ABC TV sitcom, Elon Musk waxed poetically on Twitter about the “magic” that comes from mellowing out on red wine, a vintage record and “some Ambien.” Yes, the record was Miles Davis, the Tesla CEO assured one user in his cocktail hour post, while disputing another’s view that “Ambien tweeting is a dangerous game.” ambien tweeting is a dangerous game — Sam Altman (@sama) June 7, 2017 It’s curious that Musk would deny that it’s not a good idea to tweet while under the influence of the popular sleep aid by cheekily replying, “Once you add the vintage record player, it’s all good.” Just seven months earlier, in November 2016, Musk acknowledged that “tweeting on Ambien isn’t wise.” Musk, who has recently been raging against journalists on Twitter, didn’t specify why mixing Ambien and social media was problematic. But it’s safe to assume that he must have experienced some difficulties himself, or knows people who did. Whatever the situation, Musk wouldn’t be the only person on social media to encounter difficulties with Ambien’s side effects. He also would be one of a small number of celebrities who have associated bad or abnormal behavior with their use — or misuse — of the drug. Barr’s claim that her 2 a.m. racist Twitter taunt of former Barack Obama aide Valerie Jarrett was caused by Ambien made the drug a no. 1 trending topic on Tuesday and Wednesday. “Not giving excuses for what I did (tweeted) but I’ve done weird stuff on Ambien — cracked eggs on the wall at 2 a.m., etc.” Barr wrote in the avalanche of tweets she posted, then removed, in an eight-hour tweet storm after her show was cancelled. Following Barr’s Ambien excuse claim, social media was filled with stories from people revealing bizarre things they did while under the influence of the drug. However, people were quick insist that the drug never caused them to say or do anything racist. Sanofi, the company that produces the drug, issued a statement to the media, insisting that “racism is not a known side effect” of Ambien. Well-known side effects include dizziness, headaches, impaired judgement, abnormal thinking and behavior changes, according to the drug’s FDA level. “Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition, similar to effects produced by alcohol,” the label reads. People using Ambien may also experience blackouts and loss of time, with the FDA saying that using the drug and drinking alcohol, including Musk’s recommended red wine, can increase the risks of abnormal behavior. As for the risks of taking that abnormal behavior to social media, Dr. Rachel Salas, an associate professor of Neurology in the Sleep Medicine Division at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told USA Today that people “could text or tweet while on Ambien and not remember.” For that reason, she tells people to avoid sleeping near their phone or electronics while taking the medication. Other celebrities who say the drug caused abnormal or disturbing behavior include Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s daughter Kerry Kennedy. She blamed Ambien for a drugged-driving incident in 2012, USA Today reported. Ambien also was one of the drugs found in Tiger Woods’ system after police found him asleep in his car in the middle of a highway last August. Ambien also was trending on Twitter in March, after two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn’s dazed, spacey behavior while appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Penn admitted to Colbert that he had taken Ambien to help him get to sleep after taking a red-eye flight. It’s become widely speculated that President Trump’s infamously incoherent “covfefe” tweet from 2017 was the result of taking Ambien, according to the New York Daily News. His doctor, Ronny Jackson, confirmed during a press conference in January that Trump occasionally takes Ambien, the Daily News said. The tweet, which only read, “Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” was posted at 12:06 a.m., the New York Times reported. Perhaps Trump then fell asleep, but the post stayed up for nearly six hours, bewildering the nation, before Trump removed it. In fact, one of the people warning Elon Musk about the dangers of mixing Ambien and social media in June 2017 wrote: “Ambien tweeting might be where covfefe was born from. Lol” Paul Schrader, the director and screenwriter of “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull” fame, came clean last year about why it’s not a good idea to mix Ambien with writing on social media. In 2016, he penned a late-night Facebook critique of then President-elect Trump while taking Ambien, washed down with red wine, according to the Hollywood Reporter. In the missive, Schrader dubbed the Trump presidency “a call to violence” and suggested “we should be willing to take up arms. Like old John Brown.” Schrader quickly deleted the post, with its reference to the 19th century abolitionist. But that didn’t stop two plainclothes officers from the New York Police Department’s Counter Terrorism unit from paying him a visit. “A couple of cabernets and half an Ambien, and God knows what you’ll post,” Schrader told the Hollywood Reporter after the incident.


*Elon Musk has a message for those who use any kind of threatening or abusive language to defend him, especially when it comes to personal attacks made on Twitter: You won’t get any support from him.

*SAN FRANCISCO – A Silicon Valley investor has launched a campaign to break-up one of tech’s oddest couples — Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Doug Derwin, an attorney and private startup investor, has opened a $2 million advertising blitz designed to split the Tesla CEO and clean energy tech mogul from a president signaling wholesale cuts to environmental programs. Musk sits on a presidential business advisory panel and has remained steadfast even as criticism has mounted. The campaign is the latest — and perhaps the most daring and public — rebuke of Trump from Silicon Valley. Derwin said he’s angry that Musk is collaborating with a president intent on rolling back environmental protections and hastening climate change — against the core values of Musk’s companies. “Donald Trump has to be opposed,” Derwin, a 59-year-old tech investor, said in an interview with this newspaper. “This seemed to be an issue that made a lot of sense.” Critics have targeted Musk for joining the advisory panel, even as other tech company executives like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Uber’s Travis Kalanick have shied away from the Republican leader. “Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration,” Musk said in an earlier statement. “I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good.” Derwin began his effort in March, buying a billboard ad in near the Tesla factory in Fremont that read, “Elon: Please Dump Trump.” Other billboards sprouted up on U.S. 101 and on trucks driving near the Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto and Fremont plant. Derwin said he was willing to call off the campaign if Musk renounced Trump. He met with company officials last week in Fremont and offered to donate $1 million to a charity of Musk’s choice if he broke ties with the Republican president. The company did not agree with his request, he said. The anti-Trump campaign includes a website, elondumptrump.com, and advertisements in this newspaper and other local and national publications next week. The effort will broadcast commercials on news and comedy television programs. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reading this on your phone?

*Czech Republic-based Aero Vodochody and Israel Aerospace Industries have signed a partnership agreement to develop and market an advanced version of the L-159 trainer and light attack aircraft. Vidochody, the largest Czech aircraft manufacturer and IAI will integrate new state-of-the-art avionics and other solutions on the L-159 platform and will jointly market the aircraft. The two also agreed to integrate IAI’s virtual training solutions as part of the L-39NG training system to enhance pilot training. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed."Together with IAI, Aero will be ready to offer aircraft with the best available technology. The agreement brings us together with a strong international partner with access to new potential customers,” said Giuseppe Giordo, Aero Vodochody President & CEO.The L-159 is a light multi-role combat aircraft designed for air-to-air, air-to-ground and reconnaissance missions. It has been successfully operated and tested in NATO joint operations and Red Air exercises, as well as real combat missions.The aircraft already has several systems by IAI subsidiaries, including state-of-the-art multi-mode IAI (Elta) radar for all-weather, day and night operations and optional IAI Real Time Tactical combat proven Data Link supporting a high capability of Situational Awareness presentation. It can also carry a wide range of NATO standards stores including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and laser guided bombs."The cooperation with Aero Vodochody opens up new and exciting opportunities by combining the impressive proven performance of the L-159 with new innovative IAI systems to provide customers with aircraft that meet their future requirements,” said Joseph Weiss, Israel Aerospace Industries President & CEO.While ties between the Czech Republic and Israel have not always been close, Prague was crucial in the establishment of the Jewish State and was its major arms supplier, providing almost 35 thousand rifles, pistols, machine guns, mortars, ammunitions, bombs and 25 Avia S-199 fighter jets to the fledgling IDF.Czech Defense Minister Martin Stropnicky said last year that Prague would spend some $7.1 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade the country's armed forces, and in June of last year, the Czech Republic announced that it would be sending a new attache for defense industries to Tel Aviv in charge or research, development and purchasing in the defense ministry.Nonetheless, last month Prague put on hold a NIS 500 million deal with IAI/ELTA systems for eight new 3D mobile air defense radars to cover the country.Defense Minister Karla Slechtova was quoted by local media as saying that the documents for the acquisition of the radars had not been approved by the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency, therefore making it impossible to integrate them with NATO infrastructure.“I will not accept such a major and dangerous order without connecting [the radars] to NATO,” Slechtova was quoted by local news site Novinky.cz as saying.The eight ELM-2084 multi-mission radar (MMR) systems allow for the monitoring, tracking and interception of several airborne projectiles simultaneously at an altitude between 100 meters to 3,000 meters (330 to 10,000 feet) and cover a wide area of about 250 kilometers.The ELM-2084 MMR system was expected to be delivered no later than 2021 to replace obsolete Soviet-made radars that the Czech military received in 1991.

*Elon Musk Is Getting SpaceX Closer to Mars, One Rocket at a Time Dana Hull , David Ingold David Ingold and Jeremy Scott Diamond August 14, 2017 By Dana Hull and Jeremy Scott Diamond SpaceX is about to launch its 40th Falcon 9 mission and 11th rocket this year. The rapid cadence of late is worlds ahead of where the company was seven years ago, when billionaire founder Elon Musk began firing off Falcon 9s at a pace of just two a year. As launches become more routine, SpaceX is gearing up for its next major hurdle: the maiden flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket, now scheduled for November.

SpaceX began launching commercial satellites in 2013—to both low-earth orbit , the first 100 to 1,200 miles of space, and geostationary transfer orbit , about 22,000 miles above the earth. The company has since sent a satellite into deep space and hit key milestones toward its goal of reducing launch costs by reusing capsules and rockets. Early attempts to recover boosters at sea ended in explosions . Subsequent recovery missions, however, have been successful, both at sea and on land . This year alone, SpaceX has successfully relaunched a recycled Falcon 9 , sent a used Dragon capsule back to the space station, deployed a confidential payload for the U.S. military and now is preparing for the next major step—test flying its new rocket, dubbed the Falcon Heavy . Below, see every Falcon 9 launch to date and other major achievements along the way.


*Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is in early talks with the Port of Los Angeles for additional space, according to both the company and the port. SpaceX called the negotiations preliminary and said the additional land would be used for unspecified “operations.” The company already leases 8.1 acres of land and water from the port, which is near its headquarters and factory in Hawthorne, California. Spokesmen for the port and the company did not say how the land would be used. SpaceX, which builds Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets at its sole rocket manufacturing plant, is expected to need additional factory space to construct its massive in-development rocket, named “BFR,” that’s designed to carry humans on quick hops across the world and eventually to Mars. Any new factory built to assemble it would need to be located near water to easily ship the “Big F***ing Rocket,” given its size. SpaceX -- which also has a presence in Washington, D.C.; the Seattle area and Texas -- is targeting about 30 total launches in 2018, the majority using its smaller Falcon 9 rocket.


*He spent six months on the International Space Station. French astronaut Thomas Pesquet is a celebrity at home and known the world over for his mission hundreds of kilometres above Earth. And now, just over a year after arriving back on solid ground, he’s been inspiring the next generation to reach for the stars - sharing his out-of-this-world experiences with school children at the Euro Space Centre in Belgium. "The most fantastic time of my life" Reflecting on his time in space, Pesquet told Euronews correspondent Damon Embling: "It was the most fantastic time of my life. Seen from orbit, the Earth is so small and tiny and isolated and that's what we can't really understand, what we can't grapple when we're here on Earth. "Going out the door, in a space suit, for a space walk, that was fantastic. Hanging on the outside of the ISS, just by two fingers and watching below my feet 450 kilometres of void. That was the most extreme experience I ever had." "I could smell the cologne of the people" Pesquet - an astronaut with the European Space Agency (ESA) - also remembers clearly how his senses went crazy went he came back to earth in a Soyuz capsule in June 2017. "I was very happy, very relieved. I was not feeling very good physically because coming back to Earth after six months without feeling the effects of gravity is very difficult," he said. "But actually though the feeling is like everything had been put to maximum, like the smells. I could smell the cologne of the people, picking me up from the capsule. The colours, the contrasts, everything was put to maximum. That's the kind of feeling I had when coming back to Earth." "There is a huge potential of dream" Thomas’ passion for space clearly left a mark on his young audience in Belgium. One boy said: "I really liked Thomas and he inspires me to want to go to space, because it looks incredible. You are floating in the air and I really want to do that." A girl added: "I think this was really great because he went to space. And when we enter another universe, it's good. I also want to do it." Pesquet takes pride in sharing his experiences with young people, encouraging them to realise their "dream." "We manage to inspire young people across Europe, mostly in France yes, but all across Europe which is good, because there is a huge potential of dream in what we do in space," he said. "This is not only something very dry, very technical, very scientific, this also has the potential to inspire people to achieve their dreams and go out and try hard and try to do their best. And I would certainly encourage them to do so." Another space mission? So what is next for Thomas Pesquet? Will he head back to space again for another mission? "It takes a huge amount of work on the ground to make some people fly to space, so now I am doing my part and I will continue to do so until maybe they call my number again, in which case I'll be the happiest young man on Earth," he said. "We have the ISS until 2024 at least, because everybody committed, so I am hoping before that date I get a second chance, maybe if I stay healthy."


*Well, that was fast. Elon Musk claims to have sold out of flamethrowers in just four days. The Tesla founder said on Twitter that he would stop taking orders for the $500 devices after selling 20,000. The goal was to raise $10 million for his tunneling business, The Boring Company. The Boring Company, founded in 2016, has plans to create a network of underground tunnels to ease traffic congestion. Musk, who is known for provocative antics, first mentioned plans to sell a flamethrower in December, and repeatedly plugged the idea on social media. The Boring Company insisted the flamethrower is safe. "Much like a roller coaster, this is designed to be thrilling without danger," a company spokesman said in a statement. Musk had advertised the flamethrowers as "guaranteed to liven up any party," drawing a huge reaction online. "When the zombie apocalypse happens, you'll be glad you bought a flamethrower," he tweeted on Sunday. "Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!" Related: Can Elon Musk make subway tunnels cool again? The flamethrowers will start shipping in the spring, according to The Boring Company's website. Musk said in a tweet that each flamethrower would be dispatched with a complimentary fire extinguisher. The Boring Company previously sold 50,000 hats for $20 apiece in 2017. The business is privately funded. Related: Tesla won't pay Elon Musk unless Not everyone is amused. Miguel Santiago, who serves in the California State Assembly, said he would file legislation to block the stunt. "We've now seen some of the worst wildfires in California's history, so handing out flame torchers for $500 is a really bad idea and bad public policy," he said. -- Julia Horowitz and Bill Burke contributed to this report.

*WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- SpaceX rockets may return to flight as early as Sunday, according to the company. The news comes following an in-depth investigation into the explosion of a rocket from SpaceX's September mission. The company said in a statement Monday the botched launch was due to a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank. The vessel buckled, causing liquid oxygen to accumulate. It believes this led to friction, sparks and the explosion. SpaceX conducted the investigation along with officials from NASA, the Federal Aviation Authority, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board. The Federal Aviation Administration will have to sign off on the report and issue SpaceX a license to launch. SpaceX appears optimistic it will be launching rockets again soon. To prevent such an incident from happening again, SpaceX will now load its rockets with warmer helium and revert to its older, proven method of loading helium. Down the road, it plans to change the design of its pressure vessels. SpaceX originally intended to return to space by November. Shortly after the investigation begin, CEO Elon Musk called it the most difficult and complex failure of the company's 14-year existence. The company has drawn praise for its low-cost rockets and wowed spectators by landing rockets on a platform at sea. However, the company has also been dogged by mishaps, such as this fall's explosion. SpaceX holds a NASA contact to carry U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station, but for now, it plans to catch up on delayed launches.

*Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (CBSMiami/AP) — A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was launched to the International Space Station, sending a Dragon cargo ship loaded with more than three tons of equipment and supplies, including some ice cream. As has become customary on these cargo flights, SpaceX landed its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral shortly after liftoff, a key to its long-term effort to recycle rockets and reduce costs. “Gorgeous day, spectacular launch,” said Dan Hartman, NASA’s deputy manager of the space station program. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo, which should reach the orbiting lab Wednesday. That includes 20 mice that will return alive inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule in about a month. The Dragon is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. She’s due back at the beginning of September. Newly arrived U.S. spaceman Randolph Bresnik turns 50 next month. The space station was zooming 250 miles above the Atlantic, just off Nova Scotia, when the Falcon took flight. It was the 14th successful booster landing for SpaceX and the sixth on the giant X at the company’s touchdown spot at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just a few miles from its NASA-leased pad at Kennedy Space Center. “It’s right on the bull’s-eye, and a very soft touchdown,” said SpaceX’s Hans Koenigsmann. The mice on board are part of a study of visual problems suffered in space by some male astronauts. Scientists will study the pressure in the animals’ eyes, as well as the movement of fluid in their brains. Thirty days for mice in space is comparable to three years for humans, according to Florida State University’s Michael Delp, who’s in charge of the experiment. The study may help explain why female astronauts don’t have this vision problem, which can linger long after spaceflight, he added. The Dragon also holds an instrument to measure cosmic rays from the space station. This type of device has previously flown on high-altitude balloons. The Army has an imaging microsatellite on board for release this fall from the station. It’s a technology demo; the military wants to see how small satellites like this, with low-cost, off-the-shelf cameras and telescopes, might support critical ground operations. It’s about the size of a dormitory-room refrigerator. Also going up on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation: protein crystals that, in space, might shed light on Parkinson’s disease. The mission got a televised plug from Fox, an actor who has the disease. Three Americans, one more than usual, and an Italian will tackle all this scientific work in orbit. The station also is home to two Russians; that number will go back up to three in a year or so. This is the 13th delivery by the Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX, one of two private shippers hired by NASA. The other is Orbital ATK; its next supply run is in November from Wallops Island, Virginia. The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items to Earth. It parachutes into the Pacific; the others burn up during re-entry. This particular Dragon is brand new, as is the Falcon rocket. In June, SpaceX launched its first reused Dragon, and in March, its first reused Falcon. From now on, the company said it may only fly used Dragons. SpaceX is also developing a crew Dragon for NASA astronauts, set to debut next year. Boeing is working on its own capsule to ferry space station astronauts. In the meantime, SpaceX is aiming for a November debut of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which will feature three first-stage boosters and 27 engines, versus the single booster and nine engines on the Falcon 9. It will have two-thirds the thrust of NASA’s Saturn V rocket, which was used during the Apollo moon program. All three of the Falcon Heavy’s first-stage boosters are meant to fly back to a touchdown.

*SpaceX launching research to space station _ plus ice cream hello CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- SpaceX is about to launch a few tons of research to the International Space Station - plus ice cream. An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to blast off at 12:31 p.m. Monday from Florida's Kennedy Space Center. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo. That includes 20 mice. The Dragon capsule is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream for the station's crew of six, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. As usual on these cargo flights, SpaceX will try to land its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral.


*Why Elon Musk's trusted long-time tech chief grew a beard and waved bye-bye to SpaceX Brendan Spikes was Musk’s most trusted IT lieutenant for the next 15 years. Elon Musk’s reputation proceeded him. Back in the mid-’90s at first company Zip2 – which sold software packages to newspapers to provide online city guides and directories – Musk had hit a load-balancing problem. The concept of taking requests and distributing them across multiple servers was quite new at the time, so Musk called in the engineer he’d contracted to help. “Elon was asking him some hard questions and the engineer didn’t know the answers. He just didn’t know how the algorithms worked and how it spread traffic around,” remembers Brendan Spikes, then a junior colleague of the engineer. “So Elon got frustrated and fired him. Quite a reputation, right? Well I was the next guy to go in there." Spikes, at that time still a teenager, was able to solve the issue, quickly earning Musk’s approval. He became and remained Musk’s most trusted IT lieutenant for the next 15 years, sticking by his side from Paypal to SpaceX. Until an experience at a house party in San Francisco prompted him to quit Musk’s empire and go it alone. Coolest. Thing. Ever. Tall and softly spoken, Spikes earned his education, he says, at the ‘school of hard knocks’. “If I had gone to college it would have been in 1995 and that was essentially when the web was just becoming a thing,” he tells CIO Australia at start-up hub Stone & Chalk in Sydney. “And I was in love with it. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.” A Silicon Valley native he enveloped himself in the budding tech and start-up scene. “I saw the stuff that computers were made from when they were being invented, in their earliest infancy, and got to hands-on play with them,” he remembers. “I owned a few of those early computers and learned how to program them and hack them. It was, for me, all around. You’re surrounded by technology innovation and I thought that was just normal. And I kept digging in as fast as I could.” The arrival of the internet sparked something in Spikes. “I was like an activist – how many people can I get on this web which is the coolest thing I ever seen?” he says. Bagging his first desk job at 19 as a systems administrator at Zip2, Musk took Spikes with him to Paypal – initially x.com – where, at just 21, he was given a director role (and the world’s shortest email address: b@x.com). “I was given the ability to manage and build a team for the first time. To do my job I needed people to follow my directions. It was hard to get people rallied behind me when I was young and looked young. It was hard at me to garner the sort of authority or respect that I would need to do my job,” says Spikes. 1 2 3 Next Page


*Watch out for flamethrower bearing BBQers this summer. Elon Musk, the attention-grabbing entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, has fired up Twitter and legions of his loyal followers with a brand-spanking new toy -- a commercially available flamethrower . The Future Is Flamethrower? Musk's flamethrower has already become a hit. Pre-sales have quickly sold out online. There's no word about future flamethrowers hitting the market, so this might be a gag gift or the start of a new trend. But it raises interesting legal questions which, yes, we're here to blog about. It's Easier to Buy a Flamethrower Than a Gun You might be surprised to learn that only two states regulate flamethrowers. California requires flamethrower users and buyers to have a permit, while Maryland bans them entirely. But you shouldn't be too surprised. There's never been a wave of flamethrower-related violence to spur states and Congress to enact flamethrower laws. Hence their absence. All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 1, 2018 That might change soon, however. California is already rumbling about a ban on flamethrower sales, and we'd expect other states to follow if necessary. Use Your Flamethrower Wisely What's always prohibited are crimes -- no matter what's used to commit them. Most criminal laws criminalize actions - murder, kidnapping, assault, etc. -- and "add on" counts or prison time for using prohibited items. ELON I BOUGHT 6 FLAMETHROWERS NOW THE TSA IS TELLING ME I'M ON SOME SORT OF WATCHLIST?!? WHAT HAVE I DONE PLEASE HELP -- Riccardo "fluffyblockchain" Spagni (@fluffypony) February 1, 2018 Those definitions are flexible: a car can be deadly weapon, as can be a surgeon's hands. A flamethrower might pose an interesting case for an appellate court someday, but it's not something we'd expect to be a winning argument. Related Resources

*A SpaceX rocket is ready to deliver one of the most high-tech payloads ever to the International Space Station. The launch is scheduled for 12:31 p.m. ET. on Monday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center is Florida. It marks the 12th unmanned resupply mission that SpaceX -- the private space exploration company headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- has conducted for NASA since 2012. Cargo missions are always packed with some interesting payloads -- typically several tons of experiment equipment, food and other provisions. But Monday's mission will carry something the space station has never seen before: A supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, dubbed the "Spaceborne Computer." If it works, it could be the most powerful commercial computer ever to operate in space. Astronauts aboard the space station already have a bunch of devices you'd find at your local electronics store -- including HP laptops. But a supercomputer is something different. It's a much more powerful piece of hardware that can crunch massive amounts of data and send the results to other computers in just moments. According to Mark Fernandez, the HPE engineer who is heading up this new experiment, the space-bound supercomputer will have the ability to make one trillion calculations in a single second -- about 30 to 100 times more powerful than your average desktop computer. Julie Robinson, the chief scientist for NASA's space station program, said if this supercomputer can function in the harsh conditions of space -- it'll be very exciting news for companies down here on earth. Robinson points out that a huge point of interest for the private sector is taking high-quality satellite images of earth in order to track things like crop growth or oil exploration. "What's happening is -- just as your TV now has so much more resolution -- the same thing is happening with [satellite imagery]," she said. But the high-definition images require 200 to 300 times more data, which can clog up the communication pipeline between earth and space. That's where a supercomputer on board the space station would become hugely valuable, Robinson told CNNMoney. "If you can process the data on board [the space station], you then only need to send down a subset of the data that's actually needed," she said. Will the supercomputer work? We'll find out soon enough. After launch on Monday, SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft will detach from the top portion of the rocket. It'll then fire up its own engines and spend about two days traveling through orbital space. Then, it'll dock with the space station, and the astronauts on board can collect the payload. Fernandez said HPE has volunteered to have its payload removed last, so it'll be a few days into September by the time the supercomputer makes its way onto the space station and is plugged in. "If it powers up, that's going to be my first relief. I will be very excited then," Fernandez told CNNMoney.

*Professor Leo Daniel is a former Consulting Engineer for the Arien-5 launch vehicle—current workhorse, of the European Space Agency (ESA). Since 2011, the Akwa Ibom State indigene has been Provost, Faculty of Engineering, at Kwara State University, Malete: Which now offers Nigeria’s first approved degree in Aerospace and Astronautics Engineering. A former Martin Luther King Professor of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),Daniel is leading a drive to build a miniature launch vehicle, modeled after the now-retired U.S. Space Shuttle. But in this interview with J.K. Obatala, he admits that “liftoff” for KWASU’s reusable spacecraft project has, so far, been less than spectacular. A lack of local manufacturing thrust, combined with strategic trade and information restrictions, is threatening to deflect Nigeria from its window of opportunity. Nevertheless, with the U.S. Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and the Korean Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST) as prime collaborators, the Provost insists that KWASU is still on its planned trajectory. Professor Daniel holds U.S. citizenship and resides in Gainesville, Georgia with his wife and five children. He commutes to Nigeria, every six months. What, in a nutshell, are you trying to do at Kwara State University (KWASU)? One of our main objectives, is to build a re-usable launch vehicle, like the former U.S. Space Shuttle—but much simpler and on a smaller scale. Towards this end, and to support our intensive research and instructional regime, KWASU is investing heavily in infrastructure and equipment. The Universities Commission recently approved our courses, making us the first Nigerian institution to offer a degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering. What kind of “infrastructure” and “equipment” are you referring to? We’re constructing an aerodrome (a small airport) on campus. It is the hub of an infrastructural complex that includes wind tunnels for aerodynamic testing, as well as systems for training pilots… The Faculty of Engineering structure is nearly done. Phase-1 is finished; and we’ve already moved in… Before we go further, summarize the three elements of KWASU’s research and development regime, which you previously delineated, off-tape. …O.k. We are looking at: (a) Integrating propulsion systems. That is under “transportation”; (b) Computational systems—where we have avionics and all that; and (c) The system, generally. That includes testing, rocketry and what-have-you. Who are your foreign collaborators? Right now, we’re bringing in the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), to work with us in propulsion and various other areas. Georgia Tech is also taking our post graduate students—both Master’s and Ph.D. In fact, we currently have two Ph.D. candidates, who are working on their dissertation there. KAIST is making an effort to link us to their data and information storage system. But the current situation, with North Korea, and all that, has delayed things… Are you doing any testing now? Yes. We are starting with wind tunnels. We’ve already constructed a sonic tunnel—with wind-speeds up to that of sound—for conducting tests. We are now trying to acquire a supersonic tunnel (in which air flows faster than sound). I think I should add too, that we’ve bought a very powerful computer— capable of highly complex mathematical simulations… A supercomputer? Yes. We’re trying to get it installed… In time to come, the aerodrome will serve as a test-base, for many of the things we want to do—including rocketry. Are you liaising with Professor Augustine Esogbue, Prof. Emeritus, at Georgia tech? Professor Esogbue has been talking to me…. We first met at Georgia Tech, about four years ago, when I went there—with Professor Ita Okon Bassey Ewa, then Minister of Science and Technology—for very high level talks. Esogbue lent us critical support. He was so instrumental, in getting things done, during our visit to the state. He greatly facilitated the signing of an MOU, between Nigeria, Tech’s president and the Governor of Georgia. Is Esogbue involved with KWASU, in any way? Yes…. We want to bring him on board—when we can find the money. Right now, KWASU doesn’t have adequate funds, to hire someone like Esogbue. But we are working towards that… You mentioned something about a “small space shuttle”. …We’re studying how to develop a spacecraft that functions like the former U.S. Shuttle—a miniature spacecraft (by comparison) that will fly in Earth’s atmosphere, as well as go into space and return. This means (a) designing a vehicle that can achieve liftoff and re-entry at supersonic speeds and (b) developing a TPS (thermal protection systems) to ensure the safety of its crew. We’ll be working on all these systems here… How are you going to do all this, without a manufacturing sector? When the steel industry—and other heavy industries—aren’t working? Well, that’s a good point! But, you know, the space industries in the U.S.A., Europe and elsewhere resulted from research. And research comes from the universities. Hence we’ve begun a very aggressive research initiative…The two Ph.D. students we have at Georgia Tech, are studying space aerodynamics. One is finishing next year, while the other will complete his work in two years. Our strategy, is to develop a space-exploration ethos—which has to grow out of our research. KWASU is creating a culture, generating a spirit. The industrial aspect can come later. Are you interfacing with Government, in your drive to develop a research base? Yes. We’ve signed a memorandum of understanding with the Nigerian Airforce. That is where we can actually start something. We also have an MOU with the Navy—and with some industries (whose names I cannot remember), as well as universities… Let’s return, once more, to the issue of manufacturing. Are you deliberating with Government, on the need to revive the steel industry? Well, as you know, this has long been a political issue. Nevertheless, we do have faculty members lobbying Government, to restart the steel industry. Basic steel plates, for example, can be used to manufacture many of the things we need, enabling us to do a lot more, faster. But we cannot wait until the steel industry is revived! We got to be starting something, as young people used to say! You mentioned “basic steel plates”. I lived at the Delta Steel Company (DSC) for many years. DSC has no flat sheet component. It’s only outfitted to produce billets. [Laughing] Well, we’ve built a lot of industries…that are either not functioning or not functioning properly… But that is a political, rather than a manufacturing issue, as such. If we want to manufacture, we can start on a small scale. That’s what KWASU is doing. We’ve bought small furnaces, with which to forge billets of steel. We also have tension machines to test steel structures—as well as an SEM (scanning electron microscope) and a TEM (transition electron microscope) to help us analyze the internal structure of metals… You once expressed hopes of roping Lockheed Martin—the giant U.S. defense manufacturer—into your operation. Did you succeed? Not exactly. We’re having to collaborate with Lockheed Martin through Georgia Tech. That’s because space-related issues involve classified technology and patents. So one needs ties to a U.S. university, to get certain things done. In other words, Lockheed will not collaborate directly with a Nigerian industry or university. That’s very interesting. Why? Well, I think it has to do with the security of classified information, as well as intellectual property transfer. So anything you want to do with Lockheed Martin, has to be through Georgia Tech? Yes. Georgia Tech, or any other U.S. institution, with whom Lockheed and KWASU might have a mutual agreement… That means, you’ve hit some strategic snags? Well, to a certain extent. When it comes to strategic matters, such as launch vehicles, weaponry and all that—you know, it gets very, very difficult… From whom, must you seek permission? In the case of the U.S.A., it’s ITAR—the International Trade in Arms Agreement—which has a list of controlled items. Under ITAR regulations, information and material touching on defense and military related technologies can only be released to “U.S. Persons”. Others need approval from the Department of State (or a special exemption). They will not grant that permission to us. Nigeria isn’t one of the nations that would be allowed to do this type of thing. Then, aside from bi-lateral limitations (as in the Lockheed situation), there are also “arms control” and other global protocols to contend with… So I’ve been trying to see where we can cut corners and get certain institutions to train our students in sensitive areas, like propulsion. O.k. Let’s assume you succeed in “cutting corners”. What then? …We want to make a huge impact that will help Nigeria move forward in defense systems and what-have-you… When you say, “defense systems,” are you talking about guided missiles—and things like that? Yes. Defense systems include the military, space and all the related technologies that are involved in defending the territorial integrity of Nigeria. That means satellite development, launch vehicles, etc.… Do you have any Georgia Tech people at Kwara State University now? Not now. But they used to come. What we do, for the time being, is hold telecom conferences. If a faculty member wants to teach a course, he’ll set it up and students will receive the lectures, directly from Georgia Tech. It’s very expensive. But we’re trying to make it work. The downside, is Nigeria’s shaky network system and erratic power supply. We back-up the grid system with a generator; and we keep the bandwidth of the network up to a comfortable level—so that when a lecture is going on, students will get it live, without interruptions… Why don’t Georgia Tech lecturers come here? They intend to. But there’re issues, such as confidentiality and, you know, this Boko Haram thing and all that. The prevailing situation in Nigeria, is creating some kind of fear… Insecurity… Yes. Insecurity. So they want to be quite sure, that when they reach here they will be secure and can do what they came to do, without any fear… So we are working on that. I know you as a Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). How did you get from MIT to Georgia Tech? Well, you know, when I came to Nigeria to start this programme, the Minister of Science and Technology, Professor Ewa, was very determined to develop a second space agency in Nigeria. He said NASRDA did not meet up to his vision. So I took him, with three Nigerian universities, to… Georgia Tech. I cannot be too sure, but I think the institutions involved were KWASU, Oyo State University and Ahmadou Bello University, in Zaria…That is what really resulted in me going to Georgia Tech. What are the other two universities doing? …They are not really doing much, in terms of collaboration. It’s only KWASU that is actually moving forward… What happened? I really can’t say. Maybe the management of those institutions was simply unable to interact meaningfully with Georgia Tech. Leaderships makes a big difference. KWASU has a very dynamic and committed Vice Chancellor, Professor Abdulrasheed Na’Allah. He has gone all out, to support the Aeronautics and Astronautics programme, and move it forward… How did you get involved with KWASU? I did not know anyone in Kware State. I didn’t even know where it was located, on the map of Nigeria. That is the simple truth. It was when the then Governor, Dr.Abubakar Bukola Saraki—who is currently Senate President—invited me to Kwara, that I got involved. …I must confess. When I came, I was not impressed; and I did not take the job. I turned it down three times! … Now that you have the job, are you satisfied with your decision? [Laughing] Well, no job satisfaction is one hundred percent. There are challenges here, really—to be frank… You have to be very patient. It’s not the money that’s keeping me at KWASU. They could not pay the amount it would take for me to stay… Rather, it is the passion I have, for what I am doing: The opportunity to establish an aeronautics and astronautics programme in Nigeria. I am grateful to the then Vice Chancellor, Professor Shuaibu Oba AbdulRaheem, for helping me over initial hurdles… Do you still have ties to MIT? I’m still affiliated with MIT—but not as a lecturer. It’s only for research and supervising postgraduate students. You were a consulting engineer, with the European Space Agency (ESA), during the development of the Arien-5 spacecraft. Are you still connected with ESA? Yes. That’s part of the initiative we want to bring to Nigeria… We are trying to get ESA to give KWASU students an opportunity to study in Europe and learn about space exploration, testbed development, propulsion and all that. I remember, from an earlier interview, that you hold two engineering patents. Can you discuss them? Only one. The other falls within the strategic realm of U.K. Defense and NASA. They’re using it for military aircraft—which makes it a classified issue. The ESA patent involves simulations to develop supersonic flight. It’s being used on their Arien-5 launch vehicle. It’s a collaboration and so, is not something I alone can take credit for. ESA is now developing Arien-6. Are you consulting for that project, as well? Arien-6 is actually a continuation of Arien-5. One rocket is evolving into the other. It’s an integrated system and, of course, a generic design concept. There’s not much difference between them… But to answer your question, I am not directly involved with Arien-6. Nevertheless, the engineers will definitely contact us, if the need arises … You live in Gainesville,Georgia, U.S.A.Are you going to transfer your base, back to Nigeria? Nah, nah, nah!You know, I’m a U.S. citizen. My wife would not want to come. She is a French-born Nigerian, who grew up in the U.S.A… What influences, led you into advanced engineering? Probably mathematics. I was so fascinated with calculations. When I was doing my O-level at Federal Government College, Jos, one particular equation—the quadratic and simultaneous equation—intrigued me. That is really what whetted my interest in mathematics. Bird flight also intrigued me. When I was a small boy, I’d watch birds flying in the sky and wonder about how they do it. I told my Mom I wanted to fly like that, one day. Well, I still can’t fly like a bird! But I am helping to build spacecraft and writing a book on flapping-winged flight! I went to medical school for two years. I didn’t find it funny! I hated it—and eventually switched to engineering. My Mom was furious! She had already been boasting, to her colleagues, that her son was going to be a doctor. So I had to promise her, that I’d get a Ph. D. in engineering. That way, her friends would still know me as “doctor”!


*Jefferson Starship, the band that evolved from the highly influential 1960s group Jefferson Airplane, will revisit their psychedelic roots at the Chumash Casino Resort’s Samala Showroom at 8 p.m. on Thursday, Aug. 1. Tickets for the show are $20. Paul Kantner co-founded the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band Jefferson Airplane in 1965 and later formed Jefferson Starship in 1974 with members of his former psychedelic rock group. In 2005, Jefferson Starship celebrated its 40th anniversary with a world tour, and they haven’t slowed down since. Kantner and his collection of musicians more closely resemble the band’s original mix of psychedelic rock and electric folk music, performing songs like “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love,” rather than tunes from the 1980s pop-driven era of Jefferson Starship. The band proudly boasts on its Facebook page, “We don’t play ‘We Built This City,’” in reference to the 1985 song. Jefferson Starship’s current lineup features musicians David Freiberg (keyboards, vocals), Mark “Slick” Aguilar (lead guitar), Donny Baldwin (drums), Chris Smith (keyboards, vocals), Cathy Richardson (vocals) and Kantner (guitar, vocals). Richardson, one of the newest members of the group, anchors the historic role made famous by Grace Slick and brings songs like “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love” back to life. She portrayed Janis Joplin in the original cast of the Off-Broadway play Love, Janis, and her Cathy Richardson Band was nominated for a Grammy in 2004. Don’t miss an opportunity to hear the songs from Jefferson Starship’s roots performed in the intimate 1,400-seat Samala Showroom. Located on Highway 246 in Santa Ynez, the Chumash Casino Resort is an age 18-or-older venue. Tickets for all events are available at the Chumash Casino Resort’s Club Chumash.

*After Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico and obliterated its power grid, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed interest in helping to rebuild the island's infrastructure. Given the lackluster and poorly received relief efforts by the president and US government, this has the potential to be Tesla's flagship project if they go through with it. As of publishing, only 10% of Puerto Ricans have power. After a Twitter user posed the question of rebuilding the grid with solar and battery technology, Musk tweeted a promising response expressing Tesla's interest in the project. The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017 Thursday evening, Ricardo Rossello, the governor of Puerto Rico, responded to the request saying "let's tallk." @elonMusk Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project. https://t.co/McnHKwisqc — Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 6, 2017 Early Friday morning Musk tweeted back saying that he would be "happy to talk." With such enthusiasm from both sides, it's clear that this could be a serious project and not just another of Musk's dreams. The biggest hurdle to overcome is of course funding. Puerto Rico has struggled with massive amounts of debt recently and it's not clear who would be willing or even able pay for the project. Upgrading existing infrastructure to solar is more expensive in the short term, but building a solar grid from the ground up has similar or lower costs than building new coal or gas power plants. Puerto Rico has a population of over 3 million people which would put the project on a scale never seen before. Tesla recently won a project in South Australia to power 30,000 homes with a 100MW facility. Puerto Rico's plan could be 100 times larger.

*WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A space launch was scrubbed Tuesday from a remote launch site in New Zealand after an engine glitch caused engineers to abort the flight. The command to abort came two seconds after the engine of the Rocket Lab Electron rocket fired on its launch pad at Mahia Peninsula on North Island's east coast. There was no immediate explanation for the launch attempt being called off, although mission control said the problem was reported as the engine built toward liftoff. In a tweet, Rocket Lab said the launch of the rocket nicknamed "'Still Testing' (was) scrubbed for the day while team reviews data." Advertisement It said in a statement that the weather was not expected to be favorable for a launch on Wednesday, so a new launch would be attempted "no earlier than" Thursday afternoon. The 23-meter (75-foot) rocket had three satellites on board for Tuesday's launch, each about the size of a shoebox. Founded by New Zealander Peter Beck, the company last May reached space with its first test launch, only to abort the mission when a communication glitch occurred. Rocket Lab has official approval to conduct three test launches and sees an emerging market in delivering lots of small devices, some not much bigger than a smartphone, into low Earth orbit. The satellites would be used for everything from monitoring crops to providing internet service. The company hopes to begin commercial launches next year and eventually launch one rocket every week.


*Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossello has said that he will speak to Elon Musk after the Tesla inventor said his innovative solar power systems could be used to restore electricity on the island. Musk was mentioned in a tweet, referencing an article discussing ways to restore Puerto Rico's power grid, which was knocked out by Hurricane Maria on September 20. Restoring the ageing and already-weakened network has proved slow: as of Friday 90 per cent of the island remained without power. The island's electricity company was declared bankrupt in July. Musk was asked: "Could @ElonMusk go in and rebuild #PuertoRico's electricity system with independent solar & battery systems?" Advertisement The South African entrepreneur replied: "The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. "Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR." His suggestion was seized upon by Rossello, who then tweeted: "@ElonMusk Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? "PR could be that flagship project." @elonMusk Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project. https://t.co/McnHKwisqc — Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 6, 2017 Musk replied that he was happy to talk. Restoring power to the battered island is a priority for the government, with hospitals still running on generators and the 3.5 million people struggling with a lack of refrigeration or air conditioning. Radios broadcast messages advising people how to keep their insulin cool, and doctors are concerned about people not being able to access dialysis. And, with its power grid wiped out, the Caribbean island could totally rethink the way it meets its energy needs. "This is an opportunity to completely transform the way electricity is generated in Puerto Rico and the federal government should support this," said Judith Enck, the former administrator for the region with the environmental protection agency. "They need a clean energy renewables plan and not spending hurricane money propping up the old fossil fuel infrastructure." Forty-seven per cent of Puerto Rico's power needs were met by burning oil last year - a very expensive and outdated method of electricity generation. For the US as a whole, petroleum accounted for just 0.3 per cent of all electricity generated in 2016. The majority of the rest of Puerto Rico's energy came courtesy of coal and natural gas, with renewables accounting for only two per cent of electricity generation. "In that time of extreme petroleum prices, the utility was borrowing money and buying oil in order to keep those plants operating," said Luis Martinez, a lawyer at natural resources defense council and former special aide to the president of Puerto Rico's environmental quality board. "That precipitated the bankruptcy that followed. It was in pretty poor shape before the storm. Once the storm got there, it finished the job." But Martinez told the website Earther that it might be difficult to secure the financing for rebuilding Puerto Rico with renewables from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) funds. "A lot of distribution lines were on wood poles," he said. "Concrete would make them more resistant to winds, but that would potentially not be authorized under the use of FEMA funds. "We're looking into if some of those requirements can be waived so rebuilding can be more resilient."


*By Zoe Hodgson Video will play in Play now Don't auto play Never auto play Tech billionaire Elon Musk has revealed he believes artificial intelligence could be catastrophic for humanity who are set to become a cyborg race which will have to grapple with 15 per cent of the global work force being without a job. The creative genius added a 'universal income' would have to be introduced for the global population because robots will do everything. Speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai, the entrepreneur also told the 4000 strong conference he saw space flights to the far reaches of the solar system being as common as a plane ride in 50 years. And self-driven cars were just 10 years away from usurping human driven vehicles completely. The business magnate, who was being interviewed by Mohammad Abdulla Alergawi, the Minister of Cabinet Affairs and the Future for the UAE, told the slightly perplexed crowd: "One of the most troubling questions is artificial intelligence. I don't mean narrow A.I. - deep artificial intelligence, where you can have A.I. which is much smarter than the smartest human on earth. This is a dangerous situation." He also warned world governments: "Pay close attention to the development of artificial intelligence. "Make sure researchers don't get carried away - scientists get so engrossed in their work they don't realise what they are doing." When asked if he thought A.I. was a good or a bad thing Musk said: "I think it is both. Continued below. Related Content Elon Musk offers glimpse of plans to deliver humans to Mars Tesla tops estimates after Elon Musk implores a boost Video Watch: Elon Musk on if life could be a simulation "One way to think of it is imagine you were very confident we were going to be visited by super intelligent aliens in 10 years or 20 years at the most. "Digital super intelligence will be like an alien." He then joked: "It seems probable. But this is one of the great questions in physics and philosophy - where are the aliens? "Maybe they are among us I don't know. Some people think I am an alien. Not true. "Of course I would say that though wouldn't I?" He went on: "If there are super intelligent aliens out there they are probably already observing us. "We are just not smart enough to realise it. Any advanced alien civilisation that was at all interested in populating the galaxy, even without exceeding the speed of light, at say 10 or 20 per cent of the speed of light, you could populate the entire galaxy in 20 million years max. "That is nothing in the grand scheme of things." Musk also discussed how he saw human beings as already being 'cyborgs' as we become more and more dependent on technology. To muted laughter from the crowd he explained: "To some degree we are already a cyborg - you think of all the digital tools that you have - your phone, your computer. "The applications that you have. The fact that you can ask a question and instantly get an answer from Google and other things. "You already have a digital tertiary layer. Think of the limbic system - the animal brain and the cortex as the thinking part of the brain, and your digital self as a third layer. "If you die your digital ghost is still around. All of their emails, and social media, that still lives if they die. "Over time we will see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence. It is all about the band width of the brain. "The digital extension of yourself. Output if anything is getting worse. We do most of our output through our thumbs which is very slow. "Some high band width interface to the brain will be something which helps achieve symbiosis between human and machine intelligence, which solves a control and usefulness problem." The minister introduced Musk by comparing him in brilliance to Albert Einstein but the billionaire revealed that while many may admire his genius, he wasn't that comfortable with it: "I think that they probably shouldn't want to be me - it sounds better than it is. "It is not as much fun as you think. It could be worse for sure (but) I am not sure I want to be me." The minister was also being interviewing Musk because he is launching Tesla, his electric car brand, in the Middle East. The entrepreneur said he saw cars as being totally autonomous in around 10 years. And since October 2016 Tesla vehicles have had enough computer capability in each model to be easily upgraded to a self-drive. He likened using a self drive car to 'getting in an elevator' and pressing a button. Musk said autonomous cars would be a great convenience, but also a game changer for society, adding he saw the advances in technology causing mass unemployment. This would result in huge swathes of the population losing their direction and purpose: "I think (driving) might be the single largest employer in various forms. "We need to figure out new roles - what do those people do? It will be very disruptive and very quick." Estimating there are nearly two and half billion cars and trucks in the world, he added: "The point at which we see full autonomy appear, will not be the point where we see mass upheaval. "That disruption will take place over 20 years. But 20 years to have 12 - 15 per cent of the work force unemployed is a short time." His solution was unemployment benefit for the masses: "What to do about mass employment - this is going to be a big challenge. "We will need to have some kind of universal basic income - I don't think there will be a choice. "There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better. "These are things that I wish would happen, these are things probably will happen. "I think some kind of universal income will be necessary. "The harder challenge is how do people then have meaning - because a lot of people derive their meaning from their employment. "If you are not needed, if there is not a need for your labour. What's the meaning? "Do you have meaning, are you useless? That is a much harder problem to deal with." Musk also suggested, like in The Matrix, we could even be in a created reality already and not even realise it: "Now you can see a video game that is photo realistic and millions of people playing simultaneously, and you see where things are going with virtual reality and augmented reality. "If you extrapolate that out into the future with any rate of progress at all, at 0.1 per cent a year, or something like that, then eventually those games will be indistinguishable from reality. They will be so realistic you will not be able to tell the difference from that game and life as we know it. "How do we know that didn't happen in the past and we are not in one of those games ourselves?" The business magnate also his plans for space flight revealing he would like to see travel to different planets and solar systems as a common occurrence in as little as 50 years: "I hope we are out there on Mars, and maybe beyond, the moons of Jupiter. I hope we are travelling frequently outside the solar system and nearby star systems. I believe all of this will be possible in 50 years." Musk, who is enjoying time with his children in Dubai while attending the conference, also discussed the tunnel he is building under Los Angeles to combat traffic issues. Joking he said: "It's secret plot, just between you and me." He then went on to explain: "I think the solution to urban congestion is a network of tunnels under cities. "Tunnels that go many levels deep. You can always go deeper that you can go up. "The deepest mines are deeper than the tallest buildings. Given that you can overcome the congestion in any city in the world "The challenge is just learning how to build tunnels quickly, at low cost, with high safety. "Washington DC, New York and LA and most of the major cities in the world suffer from major traffic issues." - news.com.au


*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Space Age hand-me-downs are soaring to a whole new level. On Tuesday, SpaceX plans to launch its first recycled rocket for NASA. The unmanned Falcon 9 — last used in June — will carry up a Dragon capsule that's also flown on a previous space station supply run. NASA's International Space Station manager, Kirk Shireman, said the risk of launching a recycled rocket is about the same as for a brand new one. He expects to be just as anxious as he always is at every launch. "It's still a dangerous business," he told reporters Monday. Although NASA's best rocket experts conducted an extensive review of the recycled and meticulously inspected booster, there is never "zero risk," he pointed out. Advertisement The private SpaceX has launched recycled rockets three times before, on commercial satellite deliveries. And back in June, SpaceX launched a previously flown Dragon to the space station. This latest Dragon to fly — loaded with nearly 5,000 pounds of food, gear and experiments, and likely some Christmas presents — first flew in 2015. While the notion of reusable rockets is hardly new — NASA's now retired space shuttles reused main engines and booster segments — SpaceX is intent on driving down launch costs by salvaging its boosters and other components, and reflying them again and again. "This is the beginning of rapid and reliable reusability," said Jessica Jensen, a SpaceX manager. "We want to be able to send thousands of people into space, not just tens, and so reusability is a very key part of that, and we're excited because tomorrow is just one step closer to that." As before, the first-stage booster will attempt to land back at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This will be the first launch in more than a year from Launch Complex 40. The pad was ruined when a SpaceX rocket exploded during testing in September 2016. In a $50 million rebuild, SpaceX made the pad more robust, burying support equipment and fuel lines under concrete and steel. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/


*By Ashlee Vance The day Donald Trump was elected president, Doug Derwin came into a lot of money. Derwin is a lawyer turned venture capitalist, and he'd cashed in on a successful investment. Like so many wealthy, Silicon Valley types, Derwin used the windfall to buy a Tesla electric car and stick it to the man -- or at least to the climate-change deniers he thought Trump represented. "One of the reasons I felt good about buying it was as a sort of statement in opposition to what was happening around me," Derwin says. But, as Derwin's order worked its way through Tesla's manufacturing backlog, he had second thoughts. Elon Musk, Tesla's co-founder and chief executive officer, was meeting Trump and joining committees in the new administration. The more Derwin dwelled on this, the angrier he became. And so, after receiving an email in February saying his Model S sedan was finally ready, Derwin cancelled the purchase. He still cut a check for $150,000 -- only he donated it to the American Civil Liberties Union. "Trump was using Elon to legitimise himself," says Derwin. "It says a lot to low information voters that Trump can't possibly be that bad because here is Elon Musk hanging on his every word. That's why I canceled the order. A principled opposition is important here." Musk declined to comment for this story, but he has argued that moderates should engage with Trump, rather than leaving only extremists advising the president. Derwin's personal protest has now morphed into a full-on public campaign to force Musk to sever all ties with the president. Derwin is the secret backer of billboards that appeared in recent weeks near Tesla's headquarters and factory in Silicon Valley that said "Elon: Please dump Trump." And, on Monday, he launched a website featuring videos of upset Tesla owners, "Elon: Dump Trump" bumper stickers and hats and shirts that say, "Resist." It's just the start. Derwin, 59, is prepared to spend US$2 million on Musk-Trump protests. He's bought $500,000 worth of media, including ads that will run April 23 in the New York Times, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose Mercury News, and television ads that will appear during Meet The Press, Morning Joe and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. He's going to set up information booths on college campuses in a bid to dissuade young engineers from working at Tesla or Space Exploration Technologies Corp., Musk's rocket company. He's going to offer to pay people who sent in deposits for the upcoming Tesla Model 3, if they cancel their orders. And he's going to partner with anti-Trump groups in Silicon Valley to make the Musk attack part of their campaigns. Derwin stuck to Silicon Valley law and startup investing most of his career. He's never owned a Tesla and did not follow Musk's every move as millions of others do -- which makes his new fixation all the more quixotic. His anger stems more from a dislike of Trump, with Musk serving as a proxy for that rage. Continued below.

Two charged over alleged cash kickbacks at South Auckland Maori organisations "The worst thing that happens is that I lose some money and maybe make a public idiot out of myself," he says. "But it seemed to me that it would make sense to push back on Trump in a way that I could." Musk has become a cult of personality, and it's understandable that loyal customers were upset when he started showing up at Trump Tower and then joined Trump's business advisory council. Musk has been a relentless fighter against climate change. Many Tesla customers share Musk's concerns and bought his products as statements. Trump, by contrast, has described global warming as a hoax and loosened environmental policies, while surrounding himself with people who dispute the scientific climate-change consensus. It's been hard for many Musk fans to square this circle. Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick was quick to leave Trump's business advisory council after an online backlash. Musk, though, has held his ground amid criticism on Twitter and in the press. Musk's old friend and business partner Peter Thiel is a close Trump adviser, so there's a meeting of the minds there. Musk has also argued on Twitter that it makes sense to have a moderate voice as close as possible to Trump to sway him on issues. Musk is supremely logical and smart enough to capitalise on opportunities like having a close relationship with the president. Time and again, Musk has watched lobbyists from automotive, aerospace and energy sectors sway policies in favor of incumbents, while positioning Musk and his companies as radical hucksters. Now he may have an edge with the administration and could turn things in his favor. If you're a man who wants to settle Mars and have electric cars swarm the Earth, then having friends in high places makes sense. Musk, for example, has been pushing to get Pete Worden, a longtime commercial space supporter, tapped as the new director of NASA. Worden advised SpaceX early on and could advocate for the company. Derwin, though, argues Musk has already lost whatever influence may have existed. Despite Musk's presence, Trump has moved to cut funding to the sciences and the Environmental Protection Agency, while rolling back regulations against coal mining companies. "Short of putting a big pile of old tires on the White House lawn and lighting them on fire, I don't know what Donald Trump could do that is worse for climate change," Derwin says. "Musk got rolled by Trump. He has gotten absolutely nothing." Derwin recently told Musk's camp about his campaign and asked to meet with the CEO. Musk declined, but did have three top lieutenants sit down with Derwin. Nothing much came of the meeting, Derwin said, prompting him to go live with the web site and other efforts. Musk declined to comment through a spokesman. "If Elon will resign from the boards and speak out against what Trump is doing, I'll call off the campaign," Derwin says. He's pledged to donate US$1m to the charity of Musk's choice, if Musk dons a "Resist" hat and tweets that he disagrees with Trump's climate-change policies. Derwin has his work cut out. Musk revels in the opportunity to prove critics wrong and rarely backs down from a fight. The uproar over advising Trump has died down, and Musk continues to dazzle fans and confound naysayers: Tesla's share price has surged to records this year and SpaceX has upended the aerospace industry by proving the abilities of its reusable rockets. The baggage that comes with Trump associations in Silicon Valley circles seems to have done little to dull Musk's shine.

*Well, that was fast. Elon Musk claims to have sold out of flamethrowers in just four days. The Tesla founder said on Twitter that he would stop taking orders for the $500 devices after selling 20,000. The goal was to raise $10 million for his tunneling business, The Boring Company. The Boring Company, founded in 2016, has plans to create a network of underground tunnels to ease traffic congestion. Musk, who is known for provocative antics, first mentioned plans to sell a flamethrower in December, and repeatedly plugged the idea on social media. The Boring Company insisted the flamethrower is safe. "Much like a roller coaster, this is designed to be thrilling without danger," a company spokesman said in a statement. Musk had advertised the flamethrowers as "guaranteed to liven up any party," drawing a huge reaction online. "When the zombie apocalypse happens, you'll be glad you bought a flamethrower," he tweeted on Sunday. "Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!" Related: Can Elon Musk make subway tunnels cool again? The flamethrowers will start shipping in the spring, according to The Boring Company's website. Musk said in a tweet that each flamethrower would be dispatched with a complimentary fire extinguisher. The Boring Company previously sold 50,000 hats for $20 apiece in 2017. The business is privately funded. Related: Tesla won't pay Elon Musk unless Not everyone is amused. Miguel Santiago, who serves in the California State Assembly, said he would file legislation to block the stunt. "We've now seen some of the worst wildfires in California's history, so handing out flame torchers for $500 is a really bad idea and bad public policy," he said. -- Julia Horowitz and Bill Burke contributed to this report.

*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., March 30 SpaceX is aiming for another space industry first on Thursday when it plans to launch a Falcon 9 rocket that has flown before, a key step in billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's quest to cut the cost of space flight. The rocket is scheduled to blast off at 6:37 p.m. EDT (2237 GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to deliver a communications satellite into orbit for Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES SA. Musk's SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp, made history in December 2015 when it landed an orbital rocket for the first time, a feat it since has repeated seven times. By reusing rockets, SpaceX aims to cut its costs by about 30 percent, the company has said. It lists the cost of a Falcon 9 ride at $62 million but has not yet announced a price for flying on a used rocket. SES received a discount for joining the inaugural run, chief technical officer Martin Halliwell told reporters this week, declining to specify the cost. Price alone was not the reason SES, with a fleet of 65 satellites, decided to fly on a used rocket, he said. "Someone has to go first," Halliwell said. "Really what we want to do here is encourage the launcher industry to follow this way forward." Proving the concept works is crucial to SpaceX, which is moving on from an accident in September that damaged another Florida site. SpaceX also is working on a passenger spaceship, with two unidentified tourists signed up for a future trip around the moon. The company's long-term goal under founder Musk is to fly people to and from Mars. For its 33rd mission, SpaceX is reusing a Falcon 9 booster that originally flew in April 2016. "We don't believe we're taking an inordinate risk here," said Halliwell, noting that the rocket is in sufficiently good shape that its launch insurance rates did not increase. He declined to give the cost of the SES-10 satellite. After sending the SES-10 satellite on its way to orbit, the rocket's first-stage will turn around and attempt to land itself on an ocean platform. If successful, SpaceX could fly the booster a third time, said company spokesman John Taylor. The rocket's second-stage, which is not recovered, will continue firing to carry SES-10 into an initial egg-shaped orbit high above Earth. It will provide TV and other communications services to Latin America. (Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by Letitia Stein and Bill Trott)


*A recycled SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket soars toward space above a Virgin Airlines passenger jet, which had just departed Orlando International Airport, in Orlando, Florida, March 30, 2017. REUTERS/Gregg Newton CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Thursday salvaged half of the $6 million nosecone of its rocket, in what the space entrepreneur deemed an important feat in the drive to recover more of its launch hardware and cut the cost of space flights. Shortly after the main section of SpaceX’s first recycled Falcon 9 booster landed itself on a platform in the ocean, half of the rocket’s nosecone, which protected a communications satellite during launch, splashed down via parachute nearby. "That was the cherry on the cake,” Musk, who serves as chief executive and lead designer of Space Exploration Technologies, told reporters after launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Measuring 43 feet (13 meters) long and 17 feet (5 meters) in diameter, the nosecone is big enough to hold a school bus. It separates into two pieces, exposing the satellite, about 4 minutes after liftoff. As a test, SpaceX outfitted the fairing with thrusters and a steerable parachute. "It’s its own little spacecraft,” Musk said. “The thrusters maintain its orientation as it re-enters and then the parachute steers it to a particular location.” SpaceX has focused most of its efforts and more than $1 billion into developing technologies to recover the Falcon 9's main section, which accounts for about 75 percent of the $62 million rocket. Musk’s goal is to cut the cost of spaceflight so that humanity can migrate beyond Earth. "I hope people will start to think about it as a real goal to establish a civilization on Mars,” he said. LANDING ON 'BOUNCY CASTLE' After some debate about whether the nosecone could be recovered, Musk said he told his engineering team, “Imagine you had $6 million in cash on a pallet flying through the air that’s just going to smash into the ocean. Would you try to recover that? Yes, you would.” Musk envisions deploying a kind of “bouncy castle” for the fairing to land on so it can be recovered intact and reused. The company plans up to six more flights of recycled boosters this year, including two that will strapped alongside a third, new first-stage for the debut test flight of a heavy-lift rocket. Originally slated to fly in 2013, Falcon Heavy is now expected to fly late this summer. "At first it sounded easy. We’ll just take two first stages and use them as strap-on boosters,” Musk said. “It was actually shockingly difficult to go from single core to a triple-core vehicle.” SpaceX also may try to land the rocket’s upper-stage section, a feat the company has never attempted. “Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot,” Musk wrote on Twitter on Friday. Privately owned SpaceX also is developing a commercial space taxi to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, a venture to send two space tourists on a trip around the moon and a Mars lander that is slated to launch in 2020.

*The North Korea flag flutters next to concertina wire at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia March 9, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watched the ground jet test of a Korean-style high-thrust engine newly developed by the Academy of the National Defence Science in this undated picture provided by KCNA in Pyongyang on March 19, 2017. KCNA/via Reuters WASHINGTON North Korea has carried out another test of a rocket engine that U.S. officials believe could be part of its programme to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile, officials told Reuters on Monday. The latest test follows one earlier this month, and is another sign of Pyongyang's advancing weapons programme. It comes amid mounting U.S. concerns about additional missile and nuclear tests, potentially in the near future. Several U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the test took place on Friday night and the engine could possibly be used in an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Earlier this month North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country had conducted a test of a new high-thrust engine at its Tongchang-ri rocket launch station, saying it was "a new birth" of its rocket industry. At the time, North Korea's official media said the engine would help it achieve world-class satellite launch capability, indicating the test was of a new type of rocket engine for long-range missiles. Kim also has said North Korea is close to an ICBM test-launch. North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a lift off, experts have said. Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. The reclusive state has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in defiance of U.N. resolutions. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during a visit to the region that a military response would be "on the table" if Pyongyang took action to threaten South Korea and U.S. forces. The Trump administration is still deliberating its policy on North Korea, but appears to be giving priority to less risky options than pre-emptive military strikes. It is considering sweeping sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system as part of a broad review of measures to counter Pyongyang's nuclear and missile threat.

China Daily/via REUTERS BEIJING China launched its first cargo spacecraft on Thursday, taking another step towards its goal of establishing a permanently manned space station by 2022. President Xi Jinping has prioritized advancing China's space program to strengthen national security. The Tianzhou-1 cargo resupply spacecraft lifted off early evening on a Long March-7 Y2 rocket from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Centre in the southern island province of Hainan. State television broadcast the launch live. The spacecraft is designed to dock with the Tiangong 2 space laboratory, or "Heavenly Palace 2", where two astronauts spent a month last October in China's longest ever manned space mission. The cargo spacecraft mission will provide an "important technological basis" for the construction of China's space station, according to state media. The spacecraft can carry 6 tonnes of goods, 2 tonnes of fuel and can fly unmanned for three months, state media said. Despite the advances in its space program for military, commercial and scientific purposes, China still lags behind the United States and Russia. In late 2013, China's Jade Rabbit rover landed on the Moon to great national fanfare, but ran into severe technical difficulties. The U.S. Defense Department has highlighted China's increasing space capabilities, saying it was pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations from using space-based assets in a crisis.

*COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. The U.S. Air Force is open to buying rides on previously flown SpaceX rockets to put military satellites into orbit, a move expected to cut launch costs for the Pentagon, the head of the Air Force Space Command said on Thursday. The idea of flying on recycled rockets became a reality a week ago when privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, launched a communications satellite on a Falcon 9 booster that previously put a cargo ship into orbit for NASA. That Falcon main stage had been recovered from a successful return landing on an ocean platform shortly after its maiden flight last April, then was relaunched and salvaged again last Thursday, marking a spaceflight first. “I would be comfortable if we were to fly on a reused booster,” General John "Jay" Raymond told reporters at the U.S. Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. “They’ve proven they can do it. It’s going to get us to lower cost.” SpaceX has so far won three launch contracts to fly military and national security satellites - business previously awarded exclusively to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. All those flights will take place on new Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions worth more than $10 billion. After last week's landmark launch, Musk said the company planned to fly about 20 more rockets this year, including the debut blastoff of its new heavy-lift vehicle. Up to six of those missions, including the Falcon Heavy, will use previously flown boosters, he said. Speaking at the symposium on Wednesday, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the cost of refurbishing and reflying the Falcon 9 first stage was "substantially less than half" the cost of manufacturing a new booster - the most expensive part of the rocket. SpaceX’s website lists the cost of a basic Falcon 9 launch at $62 million. SpaceX expects to reduce costs even further. The company’s next goal is to launch and return a rocket and relaunch it within 24 hours. "That’s when we’ll really feel like we’ve got reusability right," Shotwell said. Raymond said the Air Force would need to certify that a used booster could safely deliver its satellites into orbit. "I'm pretty comfortable we'll get comfortable with doing it," Raymond said. "This is just beginning.” (Editing by Steve Gorman and Peter Cooney)

REUTERS/Baz Ratner JERUSALEM State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has struck a deal worth almost $2 billion to supply India's army and navy with missile defense systems, the company said on Thursday, describing it as Israel's largest ever defense deal. IAI [ISRAI.UL] said in a statement it would supply an advanced air defense system, including medium-range surface-to-air missiles, launchers and communications and control technology, to the Indian army for around $1.6 billion. An additional naval defense system, including long-range surface-to-air missiles, would be deployed on India's first aircraft carrier, which is still being built, the statement said. The value of that deal was not disclosed, but IAI said the total package was worth nearly $2 billion. Israel is one of the top three arms suppliers to India, which shares borders with nuclear-armed China and Pakistan. Between 2008-2015, India was the world's second largest developing-world arms purchaser, according to the U.S. Congress. Until recently, India kept its defense ties with Israel under wraps, largely out of fear of upsetting Arab countries and its own large Muslim population. But Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose nationalist party sees Israel as an ally against Islamist militancy, has openly cultivated warmer ties, and is due to visit Israel later this year.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO Shares of Tesla (TSLA.O) jumped nearly 3 percent on Thursday after Chief Executive Elon Musk said the electric car company expects to unveil its planned commercial truck in September. Musk last year announced plans for electric vehicles ranging from a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi to a public transport bus, a "new kind of pickup truck" and a compact sport utility vehicle. "Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level," Musk said in a tweet on Thursday. "Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months," he added in another Tweet. Tesla's stock was up $8.14, or 2.74 percent, at $304.98 after Musk's tweets. Shares of Tesla have surged 41 percent to record highs this year, and this week the Silicon Valley company briefly became the largest U.S. car maker by market capitalization, beating out General Motors Co (GM.N). Proponents believe Tesla's stock rally and high valuation are justified based on long-term expectations for growth. Skeptics and short sellers say Tesla's growth targets are unrealistic and that the company risks being overtaken by GM, Ford Motor Co (F.N) and other deep-pocketed manufacturers ramping up their own electric-vehicle offerings.

The launch marked the first time ever that a rocket was reused for spaceflight. REUTERS/Gregg Newton CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket recovered at sea from its maiden flight last year blasted off again from Florida on Thursday in the first successful launch of a recycled orbital-class booster, then capped the feat with another return landing on an ocean platform. The unprecedented twin achievements of re-launching a used rocket and salvaging the vehicle yet again were hailed by billionaire SpaceX founder Elon Musk as a revolutionary step in his quest to slash launch costs and shorten intervals between space shots. "This is a huge day," Musk told reporters after the launch. "My mind's blown." It took Space Exploration Technologies Corp, as the California-based company is formally known, 15 years to demonstrate that a rocket typically discarded in the ocean after a single flight could be recovered and reused. The SpaceX chief executive said his next goal is to turn the booster around for relaunch in 24 hours, a milestone he said could be accomplished before the end of the year. “The potential is there for (an) over 100-fold reduction in the cost of access to space. If we can achieve that, it means humanity can become a space-faring civilization and be out there among the stars. This is what we want for the future,” he said. The Falcon 9 booster, which previously flew in April 2016, lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 6:27 p.m. EDT (2227 GMT) to put a communications satellite into orbit for Luxembourg-based SES SA SESFg.LU. The booster’s main section then separated from the rest of the rocket and flew itself back to a landing pad in the Atlantic, where it successfully touched down for its second at-sea return. "We made a little bit of history today opened the door into a whole new era of spaceflight,” said Martin Halliwell the chief technology officer for SES, who joined Musk at the news conference. SpaceX landed an orbital rocket after launch for the first time in December 2015, a feat it has now repeated eight times. The Falcon 9 booster launched for the company's 33rd mission on Thursday was also the first to make a successful return landing in the ocean. By reusing rockets, SpaceX aims to eventually cut its costs by about 30 percent, the company has said. It lists the cost of a Falcon 9 ride at $62 million but has not yet announced a price for flying on a recycled rocket. Not all the savings will be passed on to SpaceX customers, some of whom were awaiting the outcome of Thursday’s flight before agreeing to fly on a used booster, Musk said. The company spent at least $1 billion developing the technology to land and refly its rockets and aims to recoup its investment in the next year or so, Musk said. The boosters are expected to be able to fly 10 times with no refurbishment and about 100 times with moderate reconditioning, though the one launched Thursday will be donated to the Cape Canaveral Spaceport for display, Musk said. Proving the concept works is crucial to SpaceX, which is moving on from an accident in September that damaged another Florida site. SpaceX also is working on a passenger spaceship, with two unidentified tourists signed up for a future trip around the moon. The company's long-term goal under Musk is to establish a colony on Mars and ferry people and cargo back and forth between the planets. On Thursday, the rocket's second-stage, which is not recovered, continued firing to carry SES-10 into an initial egg-shaped orbit high above Earth, which it will provide television and other communications services to Latin America. SES received a discount for joining the inaugural run, Halliwell told reporters, but he declined to say how much. The latest flight brings to 65 the number of SES satellites in orbit, with nine more slated for launch this year. (Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker)

*NASA is preparing to send its long-lived Cassini probe into the unexplored region between Saturn and its rings for a scientific grand finale before the spacecraft's suicidal plunge into the planet, space officials said on Tuesday. Since arriving at Saturn in July 2004, Cassini has been exploring the giant planet and its entourage of 62 known moons, including enigmatic Titan, believed by scientists to resemble an early Earth, and the ocean-bearing moon Enceladus, which is shooting ice particles out into space. To avoid any chance that hitchhiking Earth microbes still alive on Cassini could contaminate any potential living organisms on Enceladus, NASA plans to crash the spacecraft, which is running out of fuel, into Saturn on Sept. 15. But before its demise, Cassini has one last mission. On April 22, Cassini will make a final pass by Titan and use the moon's gravity to slingshot itself into a new orbit that passes inside the 1,200-mile (1,930-km) wide gap between the edge of Saturn's atmosphere and its inner-most rings. NASA is hoping Cassini will survive long enough for 22 dives inside the rings, revealing details about the their age and composition. But if a ring particle hits Cassini, it could bring the mission to an premature end because the spacecraft will be traveling at more than 70,000 miles per hour (112,654 kph). "At those speeds, even a tiny particle can do damage," Cassini flight engineer Joan Stupik, with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told reporters during a news conference on NASA TV. Scientists hope to learn if the rings are as old as Saturn itself -- roughly 4.6 billion years of age -- or if they formed later after a passing comet or moon was shredded by the planet's tremendous gravity. During the close ring encounters, Cassini also will study Saturn's atmosphere and take measurements to determine the size of the rocky core believed to exist at the center of the gigantic ball of gas that accounts for most of its size. However long Cassini lasts, "the grand finale will be spectacular," said project scientist Linda Spilker, also with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "We're flying in a region that has never been explored before," she said. "I wouldn't be a bit surprised if some of the discoveries we make with Cassini during the grand finale are the best of the mission."

*SpaceX to launch super-computer to space By Kerry SHERIDAN Miami (AFP) Aug 13, 2017 SpaceX is poised to launch an unmanned cargo ship toward the International Space Station Monday, including a super-computer that could direct astronauts on future deep-space missions. The liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Dragon cargo ship, is planned for 12:31 pm (1631 GMT) from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The weather forecast is 70 percent favorable for launch. The mission is the 12th official trip for SpaceX, which has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to supply the astronauts living in orbit over 20 such back-and-forth journeys. About 10 minutes after launch, the rocket will attempt to make a controlled landing back on solid ground at Cape Canaveral, as part of SpaceX's ongoing effort to re-use rocket components after each take-off. If Monday's launch is delayed for any reason, the next attempt would have to wait until next week, due to a spacewalk planned for Thursday by Russian cosmonauts, who will deploy a series of satellites from the orbiting outpost. - Complicated cargo - The Dragon is packed with 6,400 pounds (2,900 kilograms) of supplies, including a sophisticated super-computer made by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), called The Spaceborne Computer. The goal is to test the computer for one year to see if it can operate in the harsh conditions of space, about the same amount of time as it would take for astronauts to arrive at Mars. As astronauts travel millions of miles away, communications will become increasingly delayed. Messages from Mars to Earth would be delayed from between four minutes to 24 minutes one-way, depending on the distance between the planets, according to the European Space Agency. "Such a long communication lag would make any on-the-ground exploration challenging and potentially dangerous if astronauts are met with any mission critical scenarios that they're not able to solve themselves," said HPE senior vice president Alain Andreoli in a statement. The new super-computer aims to provide "sophisticated onboard computing resources that are capable of extended periods of uptime," he added, describing the year-long effort as "the first step in that direction." Another experiment on board is designed to help scientists study Parkinson's disease in greater detail in the hopes of finding better treatments for this degenerative disease. Un-impeded by gravity, protein crystals can grow larger in space, and scientists hope to use this environment to help them understand an important protein in Parkinson's disease, known as Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Until now, this protein has been difficult to study in Earth, according to researchers at the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which developed the research project. Other experiments on board include a stem cell investigation for growing new lung tissue, and equipment for growing vegetables in space.

*Britain’s continuing success in the global aerospace market depends on a customs deal that preserves friction-free cross-border trade. Commenting on UK aerospace deliveries for April 2018, ADS chief executive Paul Everitt added that it is vital for the UK and EU to reach an agreement on a customs deal with no new burdens that could threaten future growth. According ADS, April 2018 saw 96 aircraft deliveries worth up to £2bn to UK industry. Total deliveries for 2018 currently stand at 406, with a total value to the UK of up to £7.5bn. ADS added that industry forecasts put the aerospace sector on track to deliver over 1700 aircraft this year, which is ahead of 2017’s total of 1498, which was worth £29bn to the UK companies. April saw 146 orders placed, pushing the 2018 total to 469, the largest number at this point in the year since 2014. Widebody aircraft have seen 127 orders in the year to date, an especially strong performance that promised a future economic boost to the UK of £6bn as the orders are fulfilled. Everitt said: “The global aerospace industry continues to grow to meet strong international demand for modern, efficient and technologically advanced aircraft. We expect 2018 will see a new record for deliveries, bringing billions of pounds in economic benefit to the UK. “As production continues to be stepped up in the years to come, we must make sure we maximise our ability to compete for new investment in capacity to produce more of the wings, engines, avionics and other critical components we make so successfully today. “April’s aircraft deliveries were worth up to £2bn to UK industry, but creating new burdens for business under a “maximum facilitation” customs arrangement could cost our four sectors up to a combined £2.3bn a year.” CLICK HERE FOR MORE AEROSPACE NEWS


*0 Historic Falcon Heavy launch scheduled: What to know CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - The Space Coast is owning up to its nickname as research and launch activity ramps up for the planned Tuesday ascent of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket. >> Read more trending news This mega mission is scheduled to blast off at 1:30 p.m. from the very same pad (39A) used for the Apollo missions. SpaceX’s pad was damaged in September 2016 when a rocket exploded. The Falcon Heavy rocket will be a test launch, starting cost $90 million. This heavy lift vehicle can place about 68.3 metric tons in low Earth orbit. The most a rocket has carried to orbit was the Saturn V with about 118 metric tons, used in the Apollo program in the 1960s and 1970s, and to launch the Skylab space station. The most recent version of a single Falcon 9 rocket can lift 13.2 tons. Weather won’t likely prevent the launch, which has an 80 percent go. The forecast includes thick clouds with 10 to 15 mph south winds. Here's more about the historic Falcon Heavy liftoff: It is a test flight. It is essentially three rockets bolted together to make the heavy vehicle. Falcon Heavy weighs more than 3.1 million pounds (loaded with kerosene and liquid oxygen) and it's about 229 feet tall. The middle booster will carry Elon Musk’s own Red Tesla Roadster. The Roadster is planned to be near Mars’ orbit in a precession Earth Mars elliptical orbit around the sun. The mission will try to prove that it is possible to put payloads into an orbit intersecting Mars. This would help in the mission to put humans in Mars. Musk presented this project in 2011, and he planned to roll out the heavy rocket in Southern California in late 2012. He hoped for a launch at some point in 2013 -- it was obviously delayed. The rockets were put in position in pad 39A and tested in December 2017. Falcon Heavy rockets cost a fraction of the price of the future Space Launch System rockets, which are planned to have more lift and put a space craft further into space, to Jupiter and beyond. They will probably not be ready until the mid-2020s. Each rocket has nine engines, making it 27 engines in total that need to ignite in tandem. The two side rockets will jettison from the center rocket two and a half minutes after liftoff. The center booster will continue for a bit longer before engines are shut off. All three rockets are planned to land back on Earth: two back at the Cape, and the heavier rocket at an Atlantic barge platform called “Of course, I still love you.” There is a good chance that this launch may fail (but we certainly hope not!). If successful, there will be more heavy launches during the first half of 2018 from Cape Canaveral. Central Florida residents, especially those near the coast -- but as far away as metro Orlando -- may hear a sonic boom. © 2018 Cox Media Group.


*TITUSVILLE, Fla. (WATE) – SpaceX is planning their twelfth commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station. Their Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft is expected to launch at 12:31 p.m. Monday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Dragon will separate from Falcon 9’s second stage about 10 minutes after liftoff and attach to the space station on August 16. NASA said primary weather concerns will be cumulus clouds and precipitation. They said there is a 70 percent chance of “go” conditions. The company says this will be the last time a “new” Dragon cargo spacecraft flies into space. They said future cargo missions will be fulfilled with refurbished Dragons that the company recovers after water landings in the Pacific Ocean.

*Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly told workers to stop performing a critical brake test on Model 3 cars as the company rushed to meet a self-imposed milestone of 5,000 cars produced per week. As electric-car manufacturer Tesla rushed to meet their self-imposed milestone of 5,000 Model 3 cars produced per week, CEO Elon Musk reportedly told workers to stop performing a critical brake test on cars. According to Business Insider, Musk told employees working on Model 3 cars in the company’s factory in Fremont, California, to stop performing a “brake and roll” test on the cars. A Tesla insider stated that testing was shut down before 3:00 a.m. on June 26, but was not aware of how long the test was halted for or why it was halted in the first place. An industry insider told Business Insider that the brake and roll test is a critical part of vehicle testing which ensures that the car’s wheels are correctly aligned and that brakes are functioning properly. Tesla representative Dave Arnold told Business Insider that every Tesla car goes through “rigorous quality checks” but when asked if Elon Musk had ordered the shutdown of brake tests himself, Arnold stated: “I don’t have anything further beyond the statement.” Business Insider included a photo of Tesla’s internal production system, which can be seen below: Business Insider notes: The far-left column shows what step the car has reached in the manufacturing process and what tasks must be done there. The two key columns here are the ones labeled “critical” and “blocking.” According to an employee at the company, they show it is apparently no longer necessary for the car to undergo this test before it leaves this step of the manufacturing process. On the far right are all the descriptions of the tasks that should be performed at this station. However, since the criticality and blocking are off, the car can leave the station whether those tasks are performed or not, the employee said. It’s not clear how many cars, if any, have left the station without doing this test. A Tesla employee also disputed the company’s claim that they had produced 5,000 Model 3’s in one week, claiming that the company likely reached its goal by finishing cars that had been taken off the production line the week previously but were held back for rework, and then preparing those cars for factory gating and counting them towards the 5,000 Model 3’s produced that week. Arnold disagreed with the employee’s claims saying: “A small number of cars are built during a week but factory-gated the following week, just as a small number of cars built the prior week may not be factory-gated until the following week. Both of those points are true for this last week of production, just as it is true every week. We are reporting our production numbers the same way as we always have.”


*[India], June 15 (ANI-Businesswire India): Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence, in cooperation with its partners, rally the Indian aerospace industry in New Delhi Today, Dassault Aviation along with its key partner Reliance Defence hosted close to 200 delegates from the aerospace industry, from different parts in India representing over 60 Indian companies and 25 French companies in New Delhi. This event in cooperation with Rafale Industrial Partners viz. Thales, Safran and MBDA was to promote Business to Business (B2B) interactions between the French and Indian aerospace manufacturers. In keeping with the Skill India plan of the government, this B2B interface between the French and domestic Indian entrepreneurs aims to deepen existing links, create new opportunities of collaboration and work towards establishing a full-fledged defense manufacturing eco-system in India. The ambition is to develop a complete supply chain allowing the completion of the existing ambitious Rafale offsets obligations under the Rafale contract signed in September 2016 (obligations representing 50 percent of the total amount of the acquisition contract of 36 Rafale) and build a strong base for the success of Rafale under the "Make in India" initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As part of this cooperation between Indian and French companies, Indian partners will benefit in a unique way from the technological know-how transfers opportunities while thousands of Indian engineers and technicians will benefit from a massive skills transfer opportunity. The Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited will be part of the planned aerospace park in Nagpur and plans to develop an indigenous value added supply chain, thereby building a strong base for success of the Rafale program under the "Make in India" initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This B2B event to connect with industry luminaries and exchanges in New Delhi envisions key partnerships with MSMEs that will position India as an international supplier in the global aerospace domain. The impetus of "Make in India" will charter a progressive path for French and Indian industrial partners to help India meet its key strategic defence requirements and pave the way for a successful induction of the Rafale aircraft in the Indian Air Force.

*FILE - In this July 15, 2017, file photo, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk responds to a question by Nevada Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval during the closing plenary session entitled "Introducing the New Chairs Initiative - Ahead" on the third day of the National Governors Association's meeting in Providence, R.I. Tesla says it’s put together a 10-year compensation package for Musk that pays him based on certain market cap and operational milestones he hits - otherwise he gets nothing. The electric vehicle maker says Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2018, its market cap would have to grow to $650B for Musk to fully vest. (AP Photo/Stephan Savoia, File) INTERNATIONAL - Anyone tracking the number of businesses Elon Musk is involved with can add one more to the list: merchandise. Specifically, a flamethrower. His tunneling startup, Boring Co., started selling a branded weapon online over the weekend. Thanks to the billionaire’s promotions on Twitter and Instagram, Boring Co. had taken orders for thousands of the $500 flamethrower by Monday. The total now exceeds 10,000 units, worth $5 million, said a spokesman for the company. Boring Co. plans to sell 20,000 flamethrowers. Musk embraced the unusual nature of his supervillian-esque side business. He joked on Twitter that the weapons would help in a zombie apocalypse but that he’s not secretly raising an undead army to generate demand. He changed his Twitter bio to “Zombie Defender.” The danger of selling a fire-emitting device and the lighthearted way Musk is treating the topic raised questions about whether it’s a joke and the legality of selling such a weapon online. The company says it’s serious.


*WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- SpaceX rockets may return to flight as early as Sunday, according to the company. The news comes following an in-depth investigation into the explosion of a rocket from SpaceX's September mission. The company said in a statement Monday the botched launch was due to a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank. The vessel buckled, causing liquid oxygen to accumulate. It believes this led to friction, sparks and the explosion. SpaceX conducted the investigation along with officials from NASA, the Federal Aviation Authority, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board. The Federal Aviation Administration will have to sign off on the report and issue SpaceX a license to launch. SpaceX appears optimistic it will be launching rockets again soon. To prevent such an incident from happening again, SpaceX will now load its rockets with warmer helium and revert to its older, proven method of loading helium. Down the road, it plans to change the design of its pressure vessels. SpaceX originally intended to return to space by November. Shortly after the investigation begin, CEO Elon Musk called it the most difficult and complex failure of the company's 14-year existence. The company has drawn praise for its low-cost rockets and wowed spectators by landing rockets on a platform at sea. However, the company has also been dogged by mishaps, such as this fall's explosion. SpaceX holds a NASA contact to carry U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station, but for now, it plans to catch up on delayed launches.

*A SpaceX rocket is ready to deliver one of the most high-tech payloads ever to the International Space Station. The launch is scheduled for 12:31 p.m. ET. on Monday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center is Florida. It marks the 12th unmanned resupply mission that SpaceX -- the private space exploration company headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- has conducted for NASA since 2012. Cargo missions are always packed with some interesting payloads -- typically several tons of experiment equipment, food and other provisions. But Monday's mission will carry something the space station has never seen before: A supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, dubbed the "Spaceborne Computer." If it works, it could be the most powerful commercial computer ever to operate in space. Astronauts aboard the space station already have a bunch of devices you'd find at your local electronics store -- including HP laptops. But a supercomputer is something different. It's a much more powerful piece of hardware that can crunch massive amounts of data and send the results to other computers in just moments. According to Mark Fernandez, the HPE engineer who is heading up this new experiment, the space-bound supercomputer will have the ability to make one trillion calculations in a single second -- about 30 to 100 times more powerful than your average desktop computer. Julie Robinson, the chief scientist for NASA's space station program, said if this supercomputer can function in the harsh conditions of space -- it'll be very exciting news for companies down here on earth. Robinson points out that a huge point of interest for the private sector is taking high-quality satellite images of earth in order to track things like crop growth or oil exploration. "What's happening is -- just as your TV now has so much more resolution -- the same thing is happening with [satellite imagery]," she said. But the high-definition images require 200 to 300 times more data, which can clog up the communication pipeline between earth and space. That's where a supercomputer on board the space station would become hugely valuable, Robinson told CNNMoney. "If you can process the data on board [the space station], you then only need to send down a subset of the data that's actually needed," she said. Will the supercomputer work? We'll find out soon enough. After launch on Monday, SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft will detach from the top portion of the rocket. It'll then fire up its own engines and spend about two days traveling through orbital space. Then, it'll dock with the space station, and the astronauts on board can collect the payload. Fernandez said HPE has volunteered to have its payload removed last, so it'll be a few days into September by the time the supercomputer makes its way onto the space station and is plugged in. "If it powers up, that's going to be my first relief. I will be very excited then," Fernandez told CNNMoney.

*Anyone who has visited SpaceX's rocket factory in Hawthorne, California, knows that the company has filled up its facilities with Falcon 9 first stages, payload fairings, and Dragon capsules. In the coming years, as the company transitions into manufacturing the Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR vehicle, it will need a lot more capacity. The company has not explicitly stated where it will build the BFR, expected to measure 106 meters tall and nine meters wide. However, it needs to do so near water, because such a large vehicle cannot be transported to the launch pad or test sites via a highway, the means currently used to move the Falcon 9 rocket. A new document from the Port of Los Angeles indicates that the company is moving ahead with plans to build a "state-of-the-art" industrial manufacturing facility near Long Beach, about 20 miles south of its headquarters. The document summarizes an environmental study of the site for the port, on behalf of a proposed tenant—WW Marine Composites, LLC. This appears to be a subsidiary company of SpaceX. The company seeks to use an 18-acre site at Berth 240 in the port "for the construction and operation of a facility to manufacture large commercial transportation vessels." Operations at the site would include "research and development of transportation vessels and would likely include general manufacturing procedures such as welding, composite curing, cleaning, painting, and assembly operations." Completed vessels would need to be transported by water due to their size, the document states, as a means to explain why the company needs a facility immediately adjacent to the water. The document also noted that the 10-year lease, with up to two 10-year renewals, would "accommodate recovery operations undertaken by Space Exploration Technologies to bring to shore vehicles returning from space that are retrieved by an autonomous drone ship offshore." This would be for first-stage recoveries of the Falcon 9 rocket and probably payload fairings as well. Although the document was approved earlier this month, it only came to wider attention on Monday when it was shared on the social news site reddit. The company did not confirm that the facility will be used for the BFR. Asked for comment, SpaceX spokeswoman Eva Behrend told Ars, "SpaceX is in preliminary discussions with the Port of LA about the potential of leasing additional land for operations." However, an independent source confirmed that this facility is, indeed, intended for the manufacture of the BFR rocket in Los Angeles. It is not clear when SpaceX would begin manufacturing vehicles in the new facilities. However, the company may begin testing the large "spaceship" portion of the BFR at its Brownsville, Texas, launch site some time in 2019. This would include testing during short "hops" of the seven Raptor engines that will provide propulsion for the spaceship portion of the BFR.


*SpaceX will attempt to launch its 17th mission of 2017 on Tuesday, a cargo supply flight to the International Space Station. Liftoff is scheduled for 11:46am ET, and weather conditions are expected to be near perfect, with a 90 percent chance of go conditions. This flight is notable for several reasons. Already this year SpaceX has re-flown one of its Falcon 9 rockets, and reused a Dragon spacecraft for a station supply mission. This mission will combine both, marking the first time SpaceX has used a "flight proven" booster for a NASA launch and combined it with a used Dragon spacecraft. This booster first flew in July (also on an ISS cargo mission), and the spacecraft first flew to the station in 2015. The launch attempt also marks a return to an old launch pad for the California-based company. When a Falcon 9 and its satellite payload blew up in September, 2016, the explosion did significant damage to Space Launch Complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch pad has been out of service since then. However, after the accident investigation closed in February, SpaceX has not only repaired the 60-year-old pad, it has made significant improvements, said John Muratore, director of the launch complex. During a conference call with reporters on Friday, Muratore said a large part of the work involved efforts to harden infrastructure at the pad for rapid rocket reuse in the future. The company does not have immediate plans to do so, but the new pad could support a launch cadence as high as one mission per week. "We've put in a lot of provisions to protect the equipment," he said. Three launch pads For example, the heat and fire from launches had been causing significant erosion of concrete lining the flame trench. The company has augmented the water system, Muratore said, which should make the facility more durable for both static firings and launches. Additionally, much of the support equipment for launches has been moved underground. Muratore said he believes SpaceX is the first company to bring three launch pads online in a single year. As a result, the company has some flexibility and can now launch from Space Launch Complex-40, as well as Launch Complex-39A in Florida and SLC-4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Moving forward, SLC-40 will launch Falcon 9 missions, with a focus on increasing flight rates for commercial customers with reused boosters. The company's forthcoming Falcon Heavy rocket, as well as commercial crew and cargo Dragon spacecraft will fly from the nearby Launch Complex-39A. The company also has the Vandenberg facility for reaching polar orbits. Tuesday's launch attempt will likely be SpaceX's last flight from Florida in 2017. It has one additional launch of Iridium satellites scheduled from California, in late December. The secretive Zuma mission, delayed from November, now is planned for early January from Florida.


*After standing down for a month due to Air Force maintenance on the launch range along the US East Coast, SpaceX will attempt to return to flight on Monday. Provided the weather and spacecraft cooperate, the company will launch a Dragon carrying about 3 tons of cargo to the International Space Station. Launch time is set for 12:31pm ET, and there is a 70-percent chance of "go" conditions for the instantaneous launch window. This will be SpaceX's 11th launch attempt of 2017, with the company already having flown more rockets into space this year than in any previous calendar year. It last flew on July 5, when a Falcon 9 rocket lifted the very heavy Intelsat 35e communications satellite, nearly 7 tons, to geostationary orbit. Because the Dragon spacecraft is only going to low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 rocket flying Monday will have plenty of propellant left behind to attempt a return to Landing Zone 1, along the Florida Coast. According to the company, this will also be the last time a "new" Dragon cargo spacecraft flies into space. Future cargo missions will be fulfilled with refurbished Dragons that the company recovers after water landings in the Pacific Ocean. This change should allow the company to move into production of crew variants of the Dragon spacecraft. While SpaceX has not been busy with launches during the last month, the Hawthorne, California-based company has been making news elsewhere—some good, some bad. Setting expectations Founder Elon Musk has had a tendency to over-promise in terms of schedules for his spacecraft hardware, and during the last month he has had to pull back on his Mars ambitions. Musk said in mid-June the company would not fly its "Red Dragon" mission to the surface of Mars, an innovative idea to land a large, uncrewed spacecraft on Mars. He also hinted that the initial version of a large rocket designed to transport humans to Mars, tentatively named the Interplanetary Transport System, would be smaller in its initial configuration. On the bright side, Musk revealed this month that SpaceX is targeting November for the maiden launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket. Already, the company has test-fired the three boosters that will be combined to form the heavy lift rocket. Musk has advised caution about the launch, however, due to its experimental nature. "There's a real good chance that vehicle does not make it to orbit," he said. "We want to make sure and set expectations accordingly. I hope that it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage." Monday's planned launch of a Falcon 9 rocket will take place from the same pad in Florida. And before it gets into November, SpaceX has a busy manifest to fly out, with at least six flights scheduled by November 1. All photos for this story were provided by Trevor Mahlmann.

*Last weekend, the Boring Company offered 20,000 novelty flamethrowers for sale. By Thursday, all 20,000 had sold out. But now Elon Musk says the company has hit an obstacle. "Some customs agencies are saying they won't allow shipment of anything called a 'Flamethrower,'" Musk tweeted on Friday night. "To solve this, we are renaming it 'Not a Flamethrower.'" To be fair, that might be a more accurate label. As Ars Technica's Ron Amadeo wrote earlier this week, the Boring Company's "flamethrower" looks like it's "nothing more than a propane torch with fancy styling." Military-grade flamethrowers can project flames 30 to 100 feet. The Boring Company's device is designed to shoot flames less than 10 feet. Conveniently, that makes it compliant with a California law regulating sales of flame-throwing devices with a range higher than that amount. But it also means that calling it a flamethrower in the first place is a bit of a stretch. Musk is apparently making things up as he goes along here. In a follow-up tweet, Musk suggested he might dub the novelty product a "Temperature Enhancement Device" instead to satisfy customs officials. Musk also announced that purchasers of these $500 flamethrowers—or whatever he winds up calling them—will come packaged with a free Boring Company fire extinguisher. They'll also come with individual serial numbers.

South by Southwest may not deliver the product announcements of CES or the in-depth technical analysis of Google I/O or WWDC-types, but Austin's contribution to the tech calendar remains perhaps the most unique annual event on the Ars radar. The 2018 event only emphasized this. SXSW remains the place where you may decide to check out the Westworld showrunners talking about season two when all of a sudden Elon Musk shows up, Thandie Newton (Mae) reveals her deep passion for improving life in the Congo, and everyone starts discussing how to inspire humanity. Or, you might decide to check out the much-hyped Ready Player One "Oasis" experience only to discover HTC quietly snuck its newest headset iteration in, and you can finally comfortably wear your eyeglasses while gaming. We came across an arthouse film festival that rivals Sundance or Cannes, only it takes place in virtual reality here. There were Batmobiles, European comment section magic, rocket engine test fire, and Mark freakin' Hamill—and most of that happened before a single band took the stage. As the event rolled along, we also took a brief gander through SXSW's gaming show floor. SXSW Gaming, which is still only a few years young, continues to have a regional, PAX-like feel. About midway through the week, suddenly anyone with a gaming itch can find local indies, playable retro games, massive merch booths, and a fair share of free-play zones for card and computer fans alike. Unlike those more established shows, however, this one also had a massive Bob Ross presence. His foundation came on site to advocate for kids' art by teaching them how to paint happy little trees. We'll continue to have stories from Texas Hill Country in the near future (because on top of all the stuff mentioned above, we also saw a ton of films). But for now, have a look at some of our favorite sights above and below to get a sense for how eclectic (err, we should say "weird" right?) Austin remains after all these years.

*Last week was the high point of the Dota 2 competitive year: it was the week of The International, Valve's biggest tournament. On Saturday, Team Liquid walked away with more than $10 million after defeating Newbee 3-0 in the grand final. Right now, one of the requirements to be a good Dota 2 player is that you've got to be a living, breathing human. The game does include some basic computer-controlled bots to practice against, but any seasoned player of the game should have no trouble prevailing over these bots, even on their hardest "Unfair" difficulty (though the Unfair Viper bot is a legendary jerk that's utterly miserable to play against). Last Friday, however, we got a hint of a new, altogether more threatening kind of computer-controlled player: an AI-controlled bot built by Elon Musk's OpenAI. The OpenAI bot took on a number of professional players and it crushed them. The OpenAI bot can't play the full game of Dota 2. It can play only one hero, Shadow Fiend, of the game's 113 playable characters (with two more coming later this year); it can only play against Shadow Fiend; and rather than playing in five-on-five matches, it plays a very narrow subset of the game: one-on-one solo matches. These aren't random choices; 1v1 solo mid Shadow Fiend mirror matches, where two humans both play Shadow Fiend against one another, are a classic showcase of individual player ability. Shadow Fiend is played this way for a few reasons. First, he has three skill shot magical attacks (near, medium, and far Shadow Razes) that put a particular emphasis on positioning and judgement to successfully land the attack (or dodge it). Second, while his regular attack damage starts off very low, he has a very powerful steroid ability, called Necromastery. Each time he successfully lands the killing blow on a creep (automated drone units that spawn every 30 seconds and mindlessly fight one another) he captures that creep's soul, gaining two points of bonus damage. This means that more than most other heroes in the game, Shadow Fiend particularly rewards accurate last hits (the Dota 2 terminology for a killing blow). The OpenAI bot doesn't know how to play Dota 2. But over hundreds of in-game hours of playing 1v1 solo mid Shadow Fiend games against itself in Microsoft's Azure cloud, the AI started to learn how to win the game. Early iterations of the bot AI would just stand around in their base, wander the map aimlessly, and end up getting killed in stupid ways. As we might expect from a bot, the AI is very strong at last hitting; it can precisely judge when to time its attacks to land the killing blows. Similarly, it's very good at precisely judging the range of its Shadow Raze spells. But the bot went beyond that, discovering other techniques that are well-known to human players. For example, the Shadow Raze spell has a short wind-up before the spell is actually cast. If a "stop" command is given during this wind-up, the spell is cancelled. This fake casting is useful because opponents will see the wind-up and try to dodge the incoming spell; a well-timed fake cast can force the opponent to move to a less-favorable position or miss a last hit, without expending any mana or putting the spell onto cooldown. The AI can also manipulate the creep positioning by selectively drawing their aggression. After about two weeks of training, the OpenAI bot was able to consistently beat the Dota 2 pros. Over the course of last week, it was pitted against big names in the scene, such as Artour "Arteezy" Babaev and Sumail "Suma1L" Hassan (both of North American team Evil Geniuses), and former pros such as William "Blitz" Lee. All of these players are known for their play in the mid lane (where one-on-one matchups are the norm); none of them took a game off the AI. On stage, we saw the bot take on Danil "Dendi" Ishutin, arguably the most beloved of all Dota 2 players and another strong mid player. The bot relentlessly crushed him 2-0. Having defeated the pros, the bot was thrown open to attendees at KeyArena. In-game cosmetics were offered to the first 50 people who could beat the bot. The bot did in fact fall, with all 50 cosmetics being won, mostly by using cheesy techniques to distract the enemy creeps or buying unusual items. This exploits a weakness of the AI; it's much less good at handling situations it has never seen before than a human would be. The OpenAI team says that playing Dota 2, even in this limited way, is considerably more complex than playing a game such as chess or Go. Not only is the range of possible actions greater, but Dota 2 has hidden information; players can stand out of vision, for example, so the bot doesn't know where an attack might come from. OpenAI's next goal is to devise bots that can play full five-on-five matches, collaborating and communicating with each other to play as an actual team. That's an enormously larger undertaking, of course, but if they can pull it off, humanity's domination of Dota 2 is clearly going to end: Skynet is going to beat us all. Listing image by Valve


*Elon Musk showed off his new 280-character Twitter limit in the best way possible Thursday morning: musing about the Singularity with the official Rick and Morty Twitter account. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO first revealed he watched the sci-fi show back in August only after a fan asked the question on everyone's mind. Musk said that while the show disgusts him from time-to-time, he's a fan, and it's 30 minutes he enjoys sharing with his five sons. Very sweet. Rick and Morty responded by promising to disgust the entire Musk family with the third season clincher. Also very sweet. And Rick and Morty delivered on its promise! Musk said the season three finale was "disgustingly good". That compliment quickly escalated to Musk's musings about the Singularity, as can only happen when you're in a Twitter thread with a billionaire trying to colonise Mars. "Kinda" disgusting? Just wait. We'll have the whole Musk family fully disgusted by the end of the season. — Rick (((and Morty))) (@RickandMorty) August 23, 2017 Final episode was disgustingly good — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017 The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like. Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017 I know that closet is nice and warm, but it's time you admitted you are one of the creators of the next one. Everyone already knows and we will still love you just as much (almost). — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017 We should definitely get a room — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017 Hell yeah, with that crew, we will party like Escobar and Cobain wish they could've partied!! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017 The Singularity, the theory that machine intelligence will one day surpass our own, is one of Musk's favourite topics. Musk even launched a $US1 billion startup, OpenAI, to ensure AI doesn't ultimately pose an existential threat to humanity and turn us all into house cats. Musk also loves to spend time debating whether or not we're in a simulation. He has said there's only "a billion-to-one chance we're living in base reality". So there you have it: Musk is debating whether the singularity has already been achieved in other simulations. It's a premise that fits very nicely with Adult Swim's Rick and Morty, which explains why Musk likes it so much. The entire premise of the show is that there are an infinite amount of universes with an infinite amount of timelines. This article was originally published by Business Insider.

*As society becomes increasingly automated by robots and artificial intelligence systems, one of the ways forward for humanity will be to physically merge with machines, Elon Musk said this week. In comments made at the World Government Summit in Dubai on Monday, the billionaire entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX said the kind of daily dependence we already have on personal technology will only increase as time goes on – to the point where human intelligence and machine thinking effectively become one. "To some degree we are already a cyborg – you think of all the digital tools that you have – your phone, your computer," Musk told the crowd. "The applications that you have. The fact that you can ask a question and instantly get an answer from Google and other things." Calling this existing dependence on personal technology a "digital tertiary layer", Musk said it's effectively already part of our neural biology, affecting the way we think, but also with the ability to outlive our physical selves. "Think of the limbic system — the animal brain and the cortex as the thinking part of the brain, and your digital self as a third layer," he said. "If you die, your digital ghost is still around. All of their emails, and social media – that still lives if they die." While it's easy to see the logic in this, the more 'out there' part of Musk's vision is how humanity will evolve in the future – especially in a world where robots can perform many of the jobs human currently do, and even outperform us. In that kind of a world, where huge numbers of unemployed workers subsist on a universal basic income, how will people find satisfaction? Musk's answer is that humans will deepen our ties with technology even further, to the point where we become cyborgs, as a way of upgrading our inherent natural abilities. "Over time we will see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence. It is all about the bandwidth of the brain," he said. "Some high-bandwidth interface to the brain will be something which helps achieve symbiosis between human and machine intelligence, which solves a control and usefulness problem." It's not the first time Musk has talked along these lines. Last year, he spoke about the need for humans to consider getting brain implants in the future to keep up with the rapid evolution of AI – a technology Musk fears could become dangerous to the world if it isn't tightly controlled. He's also been known to share some other, shall we say interesting observations about life as we know it. This is the guy who says it's not impossible – and maybe even likely – that the physical Universe we perceive is a giant simulation being run by an alien civilisation more advanced than our own, with Musk calculating that "the odds that we're in base reality is one in billions". He's also suggested that we nuke Mars to make it habitable – but we might want to hold off on that for now, since newer developments with SpaceX rockets could have us making return trips to the Red Planet in less than 10 years. Of course, as much as we love the idea of augmenting our biological selves with cybernetic enhancements that give us all kinds of new abilities, Musk's visions of tomorrow's Earth have their problems too. In a future world where it's illegal to drive cars because self-driving vehicles are so much safer, and there aren't any jobs or even household chores to occupy us, making a fresh start on Mars doesn't actually sound like such a bad idea. One ticket, please.


*“I closed out my 10-core iMac Pro Review back in December wondering how an 18-core model would perform, and happily, one finally showed up for testing!” Craig A. Hunter writes for Hunter Research and Technology. “As the two machines are otherwise very similar, refer back to that original review for a general overview of the iMac Pro (and background on my various benchmarks). Here, I am focusing on performance differences between the 10-core and 18-core models, as I suspect most buyers eyeing the 18-core juggernaut will be doing so for performance.” “This new 18-core test unit has an Intel Xeon W-2195 CPU running at 2.3GHz (Turbo boost up to 4.3GHz) with a single 24.8MB L3 cache, 1MB L2 cache per core, 128GB of 2666MHz DDR4 ECC memory, a 4TB SSD, and an AMD Radeon Pro Vega 64 graphics chipset with 16GB of VRAM,” Hunter writes. “For reference, the 10-core test unit has an Intel Xeon W-2155 CPU running at 3.0GHz (Turbo boost up to 4.5GHz), a single 13.8MB L3 cache, 1MB of L2 cache per core, 128GB of 2666MHz DDR4 ECC memory, a 2TB SSD, and the same AMD Radeon Pro Vega 64 graphics chipset with 16GB of VRAM. For the purposes of my tests, the only notable difference between these two machines is the CPU.” “In summary, we see performance increases ranging from 27% to 79% for the 18-core iMac Pro when compared to the 10-core model,” Hunter writes. “Based on pricing from Apple’s website, it costs $1,600 more to go from a 10-core model to an 18-core model. My 10-core test unit prices out at $9,599, and a comparable 18-core unit would be $11,199, a 17% increase in cost. Those are both lofty prices for sure, but considering the performance increases we’ve seen here, the upcharge for the 18-core model is a bargain. If you’re mainly interested in performance, looking at dollars per GFLOPS is a good way to compare the two machines, and confirms that the 18-core machine is indeed a better deal.” Much more in the full review – recommended – here.

It was the firm that spawned the Gloster Aircraft Company, the Dowty empire and founded Gloucestershire’s enduring role in aerospace technology. But it did much more. Martyn’s built aeroplanes, motor cars, fitted out ships, cast statues, produced stained glass windows, made furniture, worked iron, carved stone, moulded decorative plaster and excelled in every sphere of craftsmanship. Herbert Henry Martyn established his company of art craftsmen in premises on the corner of College Road and the High Street, Cheltenham in 1888. So immediate was the success of this venture that by 1900 the firm had attracted a skilled workforce of 200 from all over the country. Space was needed for further expansion. So when HH’s son Alfred took control, the company moved to a 12.5 acres site at Sunningend, which is now Lansdown Industrial Estate. A large foundry was built at the new works, which soon received its first major commission. A team of 80 worked for three months to make the iron gates for London’s Marble Arch. Weighing 40 tons and costing £3,000, the magnificent illustrations of craftsmanship in iron incorporated over 10,000 hand beaten laurel leaves. The firm was good at grabbing publicity opportunities. So when it received the Royal Warrant for decorative interior work in Buckingham Palace’s Long Gallery and Windsor Castle, the potential for boosting its reputation was not overlooked. Subsequently orders were received that established Martyn’s reputation worldwide. A stone pulpit for Brisbane cathedral. Wood and plasterwork for the Maharajah of Indore’s Lal Bagh Palace. Carving and bronze work for King Carol of Rumania. King Farouk’s royal train and commissions from Britain were also highly prestigious. Martyn’s produced the cast iron and bronze frontage to Selfridges in Oxford Street. The Speaker’s Chair and Dispatch Boxes in the House of Commons. The Cenotaph, Whitehall - all work that can be seen to this day, along with examples too numerous to mention in grand houses, the finest hotels and institutional buildings throughout the country. By 1910, over 1,000 people were employed at Sunningend, making Martyn’s the area’s largest employer. Not content with mastery of its field on dry land, the company next ventured to sea - and took to the air. First ships. Martyn’s was responsible for fitting out over 100 of the world’s greatest ocean liners, including the Titanic, Lusitania, Canberra, Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and QE2. Then planes. During the Great War Martyn’s began making military aeroplanes under contract. Demand was such that the firm leased Cheltenham Winter Gardens as extra production space. This was the birth of the Gloster Aircraft Company, which hotly contested the Schneider Trophy during the 1920s and 30s with aerodynamically elegant planes such as the Gloster Golden Arrow. Another Golden Arrow - the monster car of that name in which Sir Henry Segrave captured the world land speed record in 1929 - was also a project involving Martyn’s. Segrave commissioned Martyn’s to construct the sponsons that ran between the vehicle’s front and back wheels. Before a record breaking run these were packed with ice to cool the 930hp engine. After the run this ice had turned to boiling water. In the 1920s Wolseley motor cars were made on a sub contract basis at Sunningend. The firm also designed and built a motor scooter called the Unibus, which was way ahead of its time from an engineering aspect - and at 90 guineas was way out of the price range of its market. The firm continued to produce fine art and craft work, as well as fulfilling its engineering contracts. Between 1920 and 1937, Martyn’s produced 75 per cent of all statues, ornamental screening, decorative doors, gates and similar art metal work ordered in Britain. Right into the 1960s the company cast sculptures by Henry Moore, as well completing major commissions such as the bronze of Winston Churchill in London’s Guild Hall and the statue of Robert the Bruce unveiled by the Queen at Bannockburn in 1964. In the mid 1930s the firm was bought by Maples of London. The Second World War brought a wealth of military contracts, but when peace resumed in 1945 recession bit hard. Martyn’s probably represented the greatest concentration of craftsmanship and trade skills in the country. But the demise of Britain’s ship building industry resulted in Maples selling off Martyn’s assets and closing the company in 1971. Its disappearance was a sad loss, but many made-by-Martyn’s products still to be seen around the world are an enduring memorial to a company that was universally regarded as the best. Most of the photos seen here are taken from John Whitaker’s definitive book on H H Martyn & Co, titled The Best.

*Well, that was fast. Elon Musk claims to have sold out of flamethrowers in just four days. The Tesla founder said on Twitter that he would stop taking orders for the $500 devices after selling 20,000. The goal was to raise $10 million for his tunneling business, The Boring Company. The Boring Company, founded in 2016, has plans to create a network of underground tunnels to ease traffic congestion. Musk, who is known for provocative antics, first mentioned plans to sell a flamethrower in December, and repeatedly plugged the idea on social media. The Boring Company insisted the flamethrower is safe. "Much like a roller coaster, this is designed to be thrilling without danger," a company spokesman said in a statement. Musk had advertised the flamethrowers as "guaranteed to liven up any party," drawing a huge reaction online. "When the zombie apocalypse happens, you'll be glad you bought a flamethrower," he tweeted on Sunday. "Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!" Related: Can Elon Musk make subway tunnels cool again? The flamethrowers will start shipping in the spring, according to The Boring Company's website. Musk said in a tweet that each flamethrower would be dispatched with a complimentary fire extinguisher. The Boring Company previously sold 50,000 hats for $20 apiece in 2017. The business is privately funded. Related: Tesla won't pay Elon Musk unless Not everyone is amused. Miguel Santiago, who serves in the California State Assembly, said he would file legislation to block the stunt. "We've now seen some of the worst wildfires in California's history, so handing out flame torchers for $500 is a really bad idea and bad public policy," he said. -- Julia Horowitz and Bill Burke contributed to this report.

*Civil Aerospace Simulation and Training Market – Overview The global civil aerospace simulation and training market is growing with the rapid pace. According to a recent study report published by the Market Research Future, The global market of civil aerospace simulation and training will grow at a rapid pace over the forecast period. The market is forecasted to witness slow but steady growth by 2023, which will be a surplus growth at a moderate CAGR during the projected period (2016 -2023). The high demand for civil aerospace simulation and trainings is due to the growth in the flight training institutes. A civil aerospace simulation and training helps to artificially re-create aircraft flight and the flying environment, thus providing the real flying experience. In civil aviation flight training, such flight simulator systems are mainly used for pilot training. Compared with airborne training, flight simulation based training reduces the cost of flight crew training as well as the impact on environment. However, the high cost of producing and acquiring FFS and FTD systems acts as a barrier for the growth of civil aerospace simulation and training market. The civil aerospace simulation and training market is completely dependent on the flight training institute. Thus, the increasing or decreasing demand of the flight training institute directly has an impact on the market. The availability of finance has eased the demand for flight institutes, due to which there has been a rise in the civil aerospace simulation and training market. Another factor responsible for the increase in aerospace simulation and training market is the macroeconomic development and the rise in the global middle class consumers. This is the primary factor that drives the growth of civil aerospace simulation and training market has gained prevalence in the recent times, with growth in demand for type-rated pilots. Thus, the growth of the civil aerospace simulation and training market is expected to go hand in hand with the growth of flight institute. Get Sample Report @ https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/sample_request/1384 Despite the growth in the overall market, the global civil aviation flight training and simulation market faces several challenges as well. One of the prominent challenges is the high cost of producing and acquiring FFS and FTD systems. The majority of an into flight training providers would not be able to acquire and operate the type of simulators required for a major portion of multi-crew pilot licence (MPL) training due to their cost. Also, shortage of flight instructors with the necessary ratings and competencies, and slow pace regulatory and licencing system for new training requirements are also the prominent challenges. Despite the challenges, the global civil aviation flight training and simulation market shows immense growth potential, and it is expected to grow steadily in the future. However, flight simulator operating cost is one tenth of this figure and this would provide a huge economic benefit. Airline flight crew must undergo two days training and checking in a flight simulator every six months. There are various factors such as fleet modernisation plans of carriers, shift from traditional to simulation based trainings, long term cost benefits and flight simulation contributes to improve aviation safety that will boost the market in long term.

*Market Highlights: Additive manufacturing is a process that can build a three-dimensional object based on a CAD digital model. AM uses an ‘additive’ process, where an object is built by applying materials in successive layers as per the CAD design. Unlike the conventional manufacturing, which involves ‘subtractive’ process (e.g., cutting, drilling, milling) and forming (bending, shaping), the AM process requires minimum or no tooling to build the finished product. Weight reduction is a key necessity in modern aircraft design as it helps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. AM can create parts that are lightweight while also reducing the consumption of materials used, in comparison to the conventional manufacturing techniques. AM provides with the possibility to manufacture on-site, as and when required. It simplifies and shortens the manufacturing supply chain. AM also contributes to reduce or eliminate tooling, welding, inventory and entire assembly lines. AM also provides with the ease of manufacturing for complex parts and increased design freedoms. Increased utilization and acceptance of AM in the aerospace industry has further accelerate the growth of the market.

Get Complete Report @ https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/aerospace-additive-manufacturing-market-1551 Region Analysis The US is the single largest market for AM industry worldwide. The US leads in production and sales of industrial grade AM machines. Major AM systems producers such as Stratasys and 3D Systems are also based in the US, which have pushed the innovation in AM technology and have helped to increase the adoption of AM. US also has an advanced aerospace manufacturing base and spends a substantial amount on large R&D projects. However, the traditional manufacturing base are slowly shifting towards the APAC region, because of competitive and low-cost manufacturing capability in APAC. AM provides an important opportunity to the US to develop the high-tech manufacturing capability, and revive the competitiveness and market potential of the US manufacturing industry. Despite the current limitations of AM in terms of large scale production capability, AM provides unique opportunities to the aerospace sector, mainly to produce low-volume, and highly complex products. Many companies have realized the superior benefits of AM in comparison to the conventional manufacturing, and have employed AM to achieve supply chain efficiencies, and reduced time-to-market. As a result, AM has received the much needed attention in policy as well as manufacturing circles in the US.


*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A SpaceX capsule rocketed to the International Space Station on Monday, carrying tons of science experiments, plus ice cream. As has become customary on these cargo flights, SpaceX landed its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral shortly after liftoff, a key to its long-term effort to recycle rockets and reduce costs. It was the 14th successful booster landing for SpaceX and the sixth on the giant X at the company’s designated touchdown spot at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just a few miles from its NASA-leased pad at Kennedy Space Center. “X marks the spot for yet another picture-perfect landing,” announced SpaceX Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo, which should reach the orbiting lab Wednesday. That includes 20 mice that will return alive inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule in about a month. The Dragon is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. She’s due back at the beginning of September. Newly arrived U.S. spaceman Randolph Bresnik turns 50 next month. The space station was zooming 250 miles above the Atlantic, just off Nova Scotia, when the Falcon took flight. The mice are part of a study aimed at better understanding visual problems suffered in space by some male astronauts. Scientists will study the pressure in the animals’ eyes, as well as the movement of fluid in their brains. Thirty days for mice in space is comparable to three years for humans, according to Florida State University Michael Delp, who’s in charge of the experiment. The investigation may help explain why female astronauts don’t have this vision problem, which can linger long after spaceflight, he added. The Dragon also holds an instrument to measure cosmic rays from the space station. This type of device has previously flown on high-altitude balloons. The Army has an imaging microsatellite on board for release this fall from the station. It’s a technology demo; the military wants to see how small satellites like this, with low-cost, off-the-shelf cameras and telescopes, might support critical ground operations. It’s about the size of a dormitory-room refrigerator. Also going up on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation: protein crystals that, in space, might shed light on Parkinson’s disease. The mission got a televised plug from Fox, an actor who has the disease. This is the 13th delivery by SpaceX , one of two private shippers hired by NASA. The other is Orbital ATK; its next supply run is in November from Wallops Island, Virginia. The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items intact to Earth. It parachutes into the Pacific. This particular Dragon is brand new, as is the Falcon rocket. In June, SpaceX launched its first reused Dragon, and in March, its first reused Falcon. From now on, the company said it may only fly used Dragons. SpaceX is also developing a crew Dragon for NASA astronauts, set to debut next year. Boeing is working on its own capsule to ferry space station astronauts. In the meantime, SpaceX is aiming for a November debut of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which will feature three first-stage boosters and 27 engines, versus the single booster and nine engines on the Falcon 9. It will have two-thirds the thrust of NASA’s Saturn V rocket, which was used during the Apollo moon program. All three of the Falcon Heavy’s first-stage boosters are meant to fly back to a touchdown. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Copyright © 2017 The Associated Press.

*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Space Age hand-me-downs are soaring to a whole new level. On Tuesday, SpaceX plans to launch its first rocket for NASA. The unmanned Falcon 9 — last used in June — will carry up a Dragon capsule that’s also flown on a previous space station supply run. NASA’s International Space Station manager, Kirk Shireman, says the risk of launching a recycled rocket is about the same as for a brand new one. He says he’ll be just as anxious as he always is at every launch. As before, the first-stage booster will attempt to land back at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Advertisement This will be the first launch in more than a year from Launch Complex 40. The pad was ruined when a SpaceX rocket exploded during testing in September 2016.


*SACRAMENTO — California lawmakers added fuel to Elon Musk’s entrepreneurial fire when they cleared the way for sales of the investor’s newest — and probably hottest— product: personal flamethrowers. In the coming weeks, some 20,000 people could be walking around with the devices, which resemble toy guns but are capable of emitting flames at least 2 feet long. In California, there will be little to regulate them because lawmakers quietly quashed a bill to rein in recreational fire spitting. Let’s back up. In December, one of Musk’s companies began selling hats to raise money for its vision of drilling tunnels under urban areas to beat gridlock. Fired up by a positive public response, Musk promised on Twitter that if his Boring Company sold 50,000 hats, it would also begin selling “the Boring Company flamethrower.” He explained the logic of this merchandising leap in a later tweet: “I know it’s a little off-brand, but kids love it.” A month later, the company launched a sales page for its flamethrower, and Musk tweeted that the device was a good investment to make in advance of the impending zombie apocalypse. He also posted a video of himself wielding one with the comment, “I want to be clear that a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one. Unless you like fun.” Available at the fire-sale price of $500, the stock of 20,000 sold out in just four days. Enter Assemblyman Miguel Santiago, D-Los Angeles. When he first heard about the Boring Company’s scheme, he assumed Musk was kidding. Once he realized the investor was serious, Santiago fired off a press release criticizing his decision to move ahead with sales. “Jokes or not,” he wrote, “this subject matter, in the wake of the state’s deadliest wildfires in history, is incredibly insensitive, dangerous, and most definitely not funny. Absolutely no public good could come from the sale of this tool.” Santiago introduced a bill to limit the sale of flamethrowers in California, making it harder for consumers to buy them for recreational use, while allowing them to be used in, for example, industrial and agricultural settings. Although the bill was supported by police and firefighters, Santiago immediately faced opposition from gun-rights advocates. The Firearms Policy Coalition criticized lawmakers for trying to regulate the devices and wrote that AB1949 criminalized nonviolent behavior. “This bill,” the group wrote, “should be torched.” Santiago narrowed the scope of his bill from requiring a rigorous permitting system for flamethrowers to simply requiring them to carry a safety label. But even that weakened form of the bill stalled Friday, when it was held in the Assembly Appropriations Committee, a victim of the notorious “suspense file” process in which legislative leaders often kill bills that could pose an embarrassing vote for the ruling party. The next day, Musk announced that the flamethrowers are “about to ship,” and that his company will hold “flamethrower pickup parties” in a week or so. Just in time for fire season to hit California.

*Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice, but when it comes to what sunk the Titanic, the answer has always appeared to be crystal clear. New evidence, though, might change those assumptions, The Independent reports — a researcher now believes an iceberg isn't to blame for the ocean liner's sinking, but actually a fire that had been raging in the hull of the ship for almost three weeks: While experts have previously acknowledged the theory of a fire on board, new analysis of rarely seen photographs has prompted researchers to blame the fire as the primary cause of the ship’s demise. Journalist Senan Molony, who has spent more than 30 years researching the sinking of the Titanic, studied photographs taken by the ship's chief electrical engineers before it left Belfast shipyard. Mr. Maloney said he was able to identify 30-foot-long black marks along the front right-hand side of the hull, just behind where the ship's lining was pierced by the iceberg. He said: “We are looking at the exact area where the iceberg stuck, and we appear to have a weakness or damage to the hull in that specific place, before she even left Belfast." [The Independent] The fire was too large and too hot to be put out, with 12 men reportedly failing to quench the 1800-degree flames. Officials on board the ship were allegedly instructed not to mention the fire to the Titanic's passengers, with the ship even reversing into its berth at Southampton to keep people from seeing where the fire had damaged the ship. "Nobody has investigated these marks before," Molony said. "It totally changes the narrative. We have metallurgy experts telling us that when you get that level of temperature against steel it makes it brittle, and reduces its strength by up to 75 percent. The fire was known about, but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea." Over 1,500 people lost their lives when the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage between Southampton and New York City in April 1912. Jeva Lange


*Miami: SpaceX is poised to launch an unmanned cargo ship toward the International Space Station Monday, including a super-computer that could direct astronauts on future deep-space missions. The liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Dragon cargo ship, is planned for 12:31 pm (1631 GMT) from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The weather forecast is 70 percent favorable for launch. The mission is the 12th official trip for SpaceX, which has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to supply the astronauts living in orbit over 20 such back-and-forth journeys. About 10 minutes after launch, the rocket will attempt to make a controlled landing back on solid ground at Cape Canaveral, as part of SpaceX's ongoing effort to re-use rocket components after each take-off. If Monday's launch is delayed for any reason, the next attempt would have to wait until next week, due to a spacewalk planned for Thursday by Russian cosmonauts, who will deploy a series of satellites from the orbiting outpost. Complicated cargo The Dragon is packed with 6,400 pounds (2,900 kilograms) of supplies, including a sophisticated super-computer made by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), called The Spaceborne Computer. The goal is to test the computer for one year to see if it can operate in the harsh conditions of space, about the same amount of time as it would take for astronauts to arrive at Mars. As astronauts travel millions of miles away, communications will become increasingly delayed. Messages from Mars to Earth would be delayed from between four minutes to 24 minutes one-way, depending on the distance between the planets, according to the European Space Agency. "Such a long communication lag would make any on-the-ground exploration challenging and potentially dangerous if astronauts are met with any mission critical scenarios that they're not able to solve themselves," said HPE senior vice president Alain Andreoli in a statement. The new super-computer aims to provide "sophisticated onboard computing resources that are capable of extended periods of uptime," he added, describing the year-long effort as "the first step in that direction." Another experiment on board is designed to help scientists study Parkinson's disease in greater detail in the hopes of finding better treatments for this degenerative disease. Un-impeded by gravity, protein crystals can grow larger in space, and scientists hope to use this environment to help them understand an important protein in Parkinson's disease, known as Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Until now, this protein has been difficult to study in Earth, according to researchers at the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which developed the research project. Other experiments on board include a stem cell investigation for growing new lung tissue, and equipment for growing vegetables in space.


*New Delhi: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Florida on Monday, sending the US space firm`s last new first-generation Dragon cargo ship to the International Space Station. The Falcon 9 rocket, with the Dragon spacecraft sitting on the top, blasted off from a launch pad at NASA`s Kennedy Space Center, Xinhua reported. About eight minutes later, SpaceX successfully landed the rocket`s first stage at the company`s Landing Zone 1, just south of the launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, as part of its effort to develop fully reusable rockets. Previously, SpaceX has successfully recovered 13 first stages, five on land and eight at sea. Monday`s flight was the 12th of up to 20 missions to the space station that SpaceX will fly for NASA under a multi-year commercial re-supply services (CRS) contract. It also marked the last time SpaceX launches a brand-new Dragon 1 vehicle and the remaining CRS missions will fly only reused ones, an official from SpaceX said. A variant of the Dragon spacecraft, called Dragon 2, is currently being developed for the US-based crew transport to and from the space station, the company said. For this mission, Dragon was filled with over 2,900 kilograms of supplies and payloads, including critical materials to directly support dozens of the more than 250 science and research investigations that will occur during the next six months. "I`m happy to say 75 per cent of that total mass is headed toward our research community," Dan Hartman, deputy manager of NASA`s space station programme, said. (With Agency inputs)


*Data collected by the Cassini spacecraft, before it was deliberately crashed into Saturn's atmosphere in September 2017, show that the planet's illustrious rings are casting a shadow in ionized particles over the planet. Cassini has transmitted a hoard of valuable data from Saturn since it arrived at the planet in 2004. In its final months, the probe was sent on a series of orbital dips within the rings that reached very close to the planet itself. At altitudes between 2,600 and 4,000 kilometers, the spacecraft passed directly through the planet's ionosphere, a region of the upper atmosphere dominated by ionized particles. Data collected by the Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument on board the spacecraft reveal a relatively cold, dense and dynamic ionosphere, Jan-Erik Wahlund and colleagues report. The ionosphere is surprisingly variable and structured on small scales. One reason for that is shadows cast by the rings, which block ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, thereby reducing the ionization in those regions. However, that cannot explain all of the variation, so Wahlund et al. propose that a "ring rain" mechanism may operate, whereby water ions originating from the planet's rings interact with free electrons in the ionosphere. Variation in extreme ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, strong longitudinal wind variations, or magnetic field interactions with the rings, are other possible explanations for the variability observed in Saturn's ionosphere, the authors say.

*Main image: SpaceX is working on the most powerful rocket ever, the Big Falcon Rocket, for trips to Mars. Credit: SpaceX When Elon Musk's SpaceX first launched its Falcon 9 rocket back in 2010 it was thought of as a novelty venture by a tech entrepreneur that would be little more than a tech demonstration. No one thought it would become the de facto rocket for getting satellites, and even people, into orbit. Exactly 54 launches later, SpaceX has become famous the world over for its reusable rockets, with their discarded boosters landing dramatically back on their launch pad, or on drone-ships offshore. So far about 20 first-stage boosters, complete with engines and fuel tanks, have been recovered. The Falcon 9 Block 5 is designed to be the most reliable and reusable rocket ever built. Credit: SpaceX (Image: © SpaceX) SpaceX is aiming to both dominate the commercial rocket launch industry, and make space flight more efficient and affordable to further Musk’s interplanetary ambitions. However, one obstacle to these ambitions is that a standard Falcon 9 rocket's boosters can still only be reused twice. Cue the new SpaceX Block 5 boosters, which can be reused no less than 10 times – and possibly as much as 100 times. They have the potential to change everything. What is a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket? The new Falcon 9 Block 5 is likely the final version of a product that's gradually been improved and developed with the same Silicon Valley mindset that drives advances in consumer electronics. SpaceX strives to constantly improve its rockets, making them more reusable and more powerful, and the Block 5 features a whole host of improvements. Technically known as a 'two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle', this fifth and final version of the Falcon 9 enables each first-stage booster to be used 10 times, and just as importantly they can be cleaned up and ready to go again within weeks rather than months – in the rocket business, that's revolutionary. However, Musk has said publicly that he thinks that a Block 5 first stage could be able to launch 100 times. That kind of reusability could, in the long term, make space flight much cheaper. However, perhaps the most important upgrade the Block 5 brings is a new turbopump, which was blamed for a catastrophic failure of a Falcon 9 in 2016. Why is Falcon 9 Block 5 so important? In terms of performance and reliability the Falcon 9 Block 5 – a decade in the making – is all about impressing NASA. The new, final Falcon 9 with Block 5 upgrades will likely be used to launch humans into space from US Soil, something that hasn't happened since NASA's Space Shuttle launched for the final time in July 2011. In theory that could happen in early 2019. "Falcon 9, along with the Dragon spacecraft, was designed from the outset to deliver humans into space, and under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is actively working toward this goal," says the SpaceX website. The new Falcon 9 could soon be taking astronauts to the International Space Station. Credit: NASA (Image: © NASA) As well as manned spaceflight missions, the Block 5 improvements will also allow SpaceX to bid for more contracts from the Pentagon, such as the US$290 million deal it just struck to launch three next-gen Air-Force Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, dubbed GPS-III. Until now, United Launch Alliance (ULA) – SpaceX’s main US rival in the commercial rocket-launching business – has had the monopoly on such contracts. Has the Falcon 9 Block 5 flown yet? It was thought that SpaceX had used its new rocket for the first time on May 11 2018, when SpaceX delivered Bangladeshi telecoms satellite Bangabandhu-1 into orbit from Kennedy Space Center, then landed the booster on SpaceX’s drone-ship in the Atlantic Ocean; however it seems that wasn't quite the finished article. “Apparently SpaceX hasn’t flown its final Block 5 rocket – it decided after that launch that it’s going to add a final component that the Falcon 9 needs to meet the very stringent requirements for NASA for what’s needed to safely fly NASA astronauts,” says Laura Forczyk at Astralytical, a space research, analysis and consulting firm in the US. NASA wants SpaceX to install that turbopump, and see the rocket flown seven times without a failure. “So technically that first flight of the Block 5 rocket doesn’t count because it wasn’t the very final configuration,” says Forczyk. “But it’s still a very impressive upgrade.” Will a Falcon 9 Block 5 takes astronauts to space? Probably, but it's still not clear when. SpaceX is scheduled to send a crewed test flight into orbit in December 2018 in a Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 Block 5. Its rival for the NASA contract is Boeing, which will perform a similar test flight in January 2019 using its CST-100 Starliner space capsule and an Atlas V rocket from ULA. However, both companies – and NASA – appear to be dragging their feet. Boeing’s Starliner will also take US astronauts to the ISS. Credit: NASA/Boeing (Image: © NASA/Boeing) “SpaceX and Boeing are neck and neck in the delays they announce,” says Forczyk. “It should have happened already.” An independent assessment recently predicted that crewed spaceflights would take place towards the end of 2019. “My best guess is 2020,” says Forczyk. SpaceX has also delayed plans to send space tourists around the moon. Why the delays? SpaceX has been busy doing other things. What about Falcon Heavy and the Big Falcon Rocket? For all their awesomeness, Falcon 9 rockets generally don't leave low-Earth orbit, except when they're strapped together to make a Falcon Heavy rocket. The most powerful operational rocket in the world, SpaceX's flagship Falcon Heavy was successfully tested in February 2018. However, what Musk really wants his engineers to concentrate on is developing the massive – and entirely reusable – Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) for testing in 2020. “The Falcon Heavy is an intermediary rocket – SpaceX is not intending to put humans on that one,” says Forczyk. Not so the BFR, which is nothing less than an interplanetary spaceship, with a planned liftoff thrust about twice that of the Saturn V rockets that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon. “The BFR is what they’re planning to use to go to the moon and to Mars, which has been the SpaceX plan from the start,” says Forczyk. The Falcon 9's new and improved reusability should mean bigger profits for SpaceX, and therefore more cash that can be spent on developing the BFR. When is the next SpaceX launch? That would be June 29 2018, when a Falcon 9 sends a Dragon capsule to the International Space Station (ISS) from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Called CRS15 because it's the fifteenth such mission in SpaceX's contract with NASA as part of its Commercial Resupply Services contract, the capsule will contain supplies and science experiments. SpaceX has been sending Dragon capsules to the ISS since 2012. However, CRS-15 will use an 'old' Block 4 booster, which SpaceX won't be landing and reusing. It's the third launch in a row that's using – and losing – Falcon 9 Block 4 rockets. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin also has designs on the reusable rocket market. Credit: Blue Origin It may have invented the concept of reusable rockets, but when you've got a new toy to house, you need to clear some, er, space. If Falcon 9 was the prototype, the Block 5 improvements make it the real thing: a very reusable rocket that will eventually make spaceflight cheaper and more frequent. Almost everything is now in place for cheaper, more frequent spaceflight. The missing piece in the puzzle? That would be a fierce competitor to SpaceX that's willing to slash prices and grow the market for satellites and space tourism, which would ultimately trigger a price-drop in rocket retail. Can you think of anyone who might be qualified? Just a couple of miles from Kennedy Space Center and the SpaceX launch facility, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has just moved in to a massive new reusable rocket manufacturing plant. The reusable rocket price war is coming. TechRadar's Next Up series is brought to you in association with Honor

*ALPHARETTA, Ga. — May 15, 2018 — Solvay launches FusePly™, a breakthrough composite bonding technology, at SAMPE Long Beach, May 22-23, 2018. Solvay developed FusePly to enable the build of reliable, bonded composite parts using conventional manufacturing processes, through the creation of covalently bonded structures thus potentially removing the need for abundant rivets and fasteners. It addresses the manufacturing challenges faced by aircraft builders looking for improved performance, build rates and lightweighting. FusePly offers clear step-change bonding performance and benefits to users: Improved reliability: Through the creation of chemical bonds, FusePly enables part manufacturers to have increased confidence in bonded structures. Higher part performance: Compared to mechanical fasteners, FusePly offers higher performance since drilling holes into fiber-reinforced structures introduces structural damage and creates stress concentrations that ultimately reduce the load capacity of the part. Lightweighting: The reduction and replacement of fasteners with FusePly bonding will substantially reduce the overall weight of the aircraft. Design freedom: Adhesives offer much greater design flexibility during manufacture and assembly at lower cost. FusePly can easily be integrated into existing manufacturing processes as an upgrade for traditional surface preparation methods. Solvay will be introducing FusePly at SAMPE Long Beach 2018.

*At present, India imposes 60% customs duty on import of completely-built electric cars priced less than $40,000. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi: The US-based electric car major Tesla is in discussion with Indian government seeking relief on import duties till a local factory is built here, according to the company’s CEO Elon Musk. Earlier this year, Musk had stated that he was hoping for Tesla to enter India this summer with its products, which has so far not materialised. “In discussion with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built,” Musk said in a tweet. At present, India imposes 60% customs duty on import of completely-built electric cars priced less than $40,000. If the electric car is assembled in India, the customs duty on the completely knocked down units is 10 per cent. If the value of the imported car is more than $40,000 the customs duty is 100%. Replying to Musk’s tweet, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar asked if there was an option to import some right hand drive Model X in India and indicated that, if so he would pay full duties. Last year in April, Tesla had stated that it planned to enter India with its Model 3 in 2017 while it began global rollout of the vehicle in late 2016. Model 3 is Tesla’s most affordable car yet and achieves 215 miles of range per charge while starting at $35,000 before incentives. The company’s other models include Model S and Model X. Musk has been showing increasing interest in the country of late and had earlier this month tweeted about India’s commitment to sell only electric cars by 2030. “It is already the largest market for solar power,” he had tweeted. Mahindra group Chairman Anand Mahindra responded to Musk’s tweet in a lighter vein saying, “time you got out here Elon. You don’t want to leave that whole market to Mahindra do you?? The more the merrier- and greener !”


*Consumer Reports reversed course Wednesday and endorsed the new Tesla Model 3 after previously declining to recommend the electric car, saying that the company had quickly improved the vehicle's brakes. The consumer advice publication's turnabout comes after a spat with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who called the initial review "very strange" and said reviewers had tested "an early production car." Musk's criticism came as he also bashed the news media in general in recent days over what he believes is unfair coverage. Consumer Reports said Tesla issued an over-the-air software update to improve the Model 3's brakes. The reviewers had originally reported a stopping distance that "was far worse than any contemporary car we've tested" and even longer than a full-size pickup. That fueled what they called "big flaws," including difficult vehicle controls and excessive wind noise. Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, told USA TODAY that he spoke with Musk for an hour last week after the initial review was posted. Musk, he said, was "very interested to understand what was going on in our testing."

"There are still other flaws with the vehicle," Fisher said in an interview. "Those have not necessarily been addressed. It’s not the top in its category but it's certainly a vehicle that scores high enough to recommend." Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month. https://t.co/ZMLPJxmPlM — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 30, 2018 The ability to improve vehicles with wireless updates is largely exclusive to Tesla. Fisher said he was impressed at the company's ability to quickly adjust. After the upgrade, "the braking distances were much shorter and they were consistent," he said. Musk said on Twitter that the update would apply to all Model 3 vehicles. "Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports," he said. He also said the company is addressing the road noise and ride comfort issues, as well as infotainment usability.

*Get Business updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Business Secretary Greg Clark has waved through the sale of one Britain's oldest engineering firms to a controversial investment group. Mr Clark dismissed claims of a "predatory" takeover as he confirmed the sale of GKN to Melrose Industries in the House of Commons. The embattled engineering business, which employs 1,600 people at its aerospace division in Filton and 300 in Avonmouth, dates back to the 1900s and was instrumental in wartime manufacturing. Labour had called for the sale of GKN to be blocked on national security grounds, as the company provides many Ministry of Defence contracts, but this was rejected. Filton employees are "seriously concerned" about their jobs. The aerospace sector provides more than 15,000 jobs in the South West, making the region the country’s largest sector employer. Dale Howarth, an employee at the site and a Unite union representative, said: “I'm worried about what impact it will have for all employees." Mr Clark told MPs of the numerous assurances given by Melrose as part of the £8.1 billion takeover deal. (Image: Jerome Ellerby) He said: "The MoD has completed its detailed analysis and has agreed with Melrose a series of undertakings specifically to ensure that the Government is informed in advance of any plans to divest a business, a component of the business or assets which engage in activities that the Ministry of Defence considers to have national security implications." Mr Clark said the Government had been given "suitable protections" from any subsequent sale of the business and had been given assurances over the continuation of contractual obligations "to protect intellectual property and classified information". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told ministers the assurances were "not sufficient to guarantee security of the long-term prospects" of the company or the workforce. She said: "Melrose are reportedly short-termist in their outlook which undermines the long-term thinking required in defence projects. "What we needed today from the secretary was not just a waving through of the deal, we needed action both in terms of obtaining concrete assurances from Melrose on the future of GKN and its workforce, but also clear plans to reform and widen our takeover regime to protect British businesses. "I fear the short-term predators already smell their next victim and it's not just Melrose, it's Britain's industrial future." Mr Clark hit back telling Ms Long-Bailey she had "prejudiced her position" by advancing the takeover should be blocked from the outset and had "given away the ability to have influence". The Business Secretary added: "This is the responsible way to proceed and she would do the employees and stakeholders of GKN a service if she would engage more forensically in future." Bristol's metro mayor Tim Bowles and the city’s mayor Marvin Rees have urged the government to protect jobs. A letter sent to Mr Clark in February, which was also signed by other members of the West of England Joint Committee, said: “GKN acts as an anchor for high productivity sectors in Bristol, supporting innovation and new business investment… The potential takeover could have serious consequences There could be a loss of high-skilled well-paid jobs, which help support our regional economy." Melrose won its takeover battle to buy GKN in March after securing the backing of the engineering giant's shareholders. A total of 52.43 per cent investor votes were cast in favour of the deal, just above the 50 per cent plus one share threshold. Its victory brought to a close a bitter battle that has raged since January, with unions and MPs warning of job cuts and asset stripping.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Business Secretary Greg Clark has waved through the sale of one Britain's oldest engineering firms to a controversial investment group. Mr Clark dismissed claims of a "predatory" takeover as he confirmed the sale of GKN to Melrose Industries in the House of Commons. The embattled engineering business, which employs 1,600 people at its aerospace division in Filton and 300 in Avonmouth, dates back to the 1900s and was instrumental in wartime manufacturing. Labour had called for the sale of GKN to be blocked on national security grounds, as the company provides many Ministry of Defence contracts, but this was rejected. Filton employees are "seriously concerned" about their jobs. The aerospace sector provides more than 15,000 jobs in the South West, making the region the country’s largest sector employer. Dale Howarth, an employee at the site and a Unite union representative, said: “I'm worried about what impact it will have for all employees." Mr Clark told MPs of the numerous assurances given by Melrose as part of the £8.1 billion takeover deal. (Image: Jerome Ellerby) He said: "The MoD has completed its detailed analysis and has agreed with Melrose a series of undertakings specifically to ensure that the Government is informed in advance of any plans to divest a business, a component of the business or assets which engage in activities that the Ministry of Defence considers to have national security implications." Mr Clark said the Government had been given "suitable protections" from any subsequent sale of the business and had been given assurances over the continuation of contractual obligations "to protect intellectual property and classified information". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told ministers the assurances were "not sufficient to guarantee security of the long-term prospects" of the company or the workforce. She said: "Melrose are reportedly short-termist in their outlook which undermines the long-term thinking required in defence projects. "What we needed today from the secretary was not just a waving through of the deal, we needed action both in terms of obtaining concrete assurances from Melrose on the future of GKN and its workforce, but also clear plans to reform and widen our takeover regime to protect British businesses.

*While Elon Musk is busy trying to colonise Mars, it would seem that his former employee-turned-arch-rival is coolly encroaching on the Electronic Vehicles market. For the longest time, EVs were almost synonymous with Elon Musk, the bold face of Tesla, who promised to change the world as we know it. Musk’s nemesis is Henrik Fisker, a man who hasn’t just designed some of the most iconic James Bond cars but is also now claiming a piece of the EV pie that so far was firmly on Musk’s side of the table. While Tesla may still be a top-of-the-line machine, Fisker clearly wants to challenge the domination with his game-changing electric car… erm… EMotion. Its underwhelming name notwithstanding, EMotion’s specs are bound to make Elon Musk sit up, take note, perhaps fidget with his shirt collar and increase his Ambien dosage. Because EMotion boasts of a top speed of 259 kph and a range of 643 km on a full battery charge. That’s a significant improvement on Tesla’s Model S that has a humbler range of 563 km and top speed of 250 kph. Could EMotion be a Tesla-killer? Before we get ahead of ourselves, you should know that Fisker vs Tesla isn’t just your regular market beef. There’s a lot of bad blood between the two. In 2008, Tesla had filed a lawsuit against Fisker’s design company, the Fisker Coachbuild for allegedly stealing Tesla’s design documents and concepts while he was working with Tesla as a contractor on their early hybrid cars. Fisker apparently pulled a Mark Zuckerberg on Tesla by quitting midway and start working on his own hybrid supercar, the Fisker Karma (which was to launch along with the Tesla hybrid in 2010). The lawsuit resulted in Musk’s Winklevoss moment, with the court ruling in favour of Fisker and even asking Tesla to foot the legal charges (around $1.14 million). Now, getting back to EMotion – Fisker’s EV reportedly makes use of advanced battery technology and focusses a lot on – what has been called the Achilles’ Heel of Tesla – charging time. The Model S takes about nine hours for a full charge at a regular station and 40 minutes at Tesla’s Supercharging Stations. That’s tad longer than your average fuel station loo break. But EMotion, according to Fisker Inc’s claims, can do a fast charge in a previously unheard of time of n-i-n-e minutes making it comparable to filling gasoline. For now, Fisker Inc has kept details about EMotion under wraps. While we know that it will be launched formally in August 2017 and the fact that it will have connected capabilities, almost nothing is known about the car. However, sometime last month, Fisker did reveal a cool bit of information in a tweet saying the EMotion will feature Lipik Electrochromic glass on roof and side-windows – which means you can modify their tint electronically at the touch of a button. Fisker EMotion with 400+ mile EV range, will have Lipik Electrochromic glass on the roof & rear side windows: tints on a touch of a button! pic.twitter.com/7dpUuHEGf0 — Henrik Fisker (@FiskerOfficial) May 4, 2017 With the high-end EV market getting crowded by the day with the likes of performance-focussed Faraday Future and Rimac – Fisker’s focus on charging time makes it a real dark horse in the race to mass-market appeal and the fight against a Tesla hegemony.

*NASA is celebrating 60 years of its space exploration which started with the launch of its Explorer 1 satellite on January 31, 1958, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Jupiter-C rocket launched the satellite developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with scientific instruments developed by the University of Iowa. The satellite reached its orbit in seven and half minutes after its launch. Explorer satellite was launched as America's first step in space exploration, as a fall out of the cold war with Russia, which had already launched its Sputnik satellites a year earlier in October and November 1957 gaining an upper hand in space exploration. America's first satellite failed during its maiden launch in December 1957 as it exploded seconds after its liftoff. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science had said, "Explorer 1 was a beginning. It was the beginning of going beyond our sphere of life out into space. At first, quite frankly, space looked like a pretty boring place. But the instrument that Van Allen and his team built showed that space is beautiful." The instruments aboard Explorer 1 measured and sent back data on temperature, micrometeorites, and cosmic rays, or high-energy radiation for four months. The satellite had a Geiger counter developed by James Van Allen of the University of Iowa for measuring cosmic rays. The instrument had identified a belt of radiation around Earth which was later named after the instruments developer. Van Allen radiation belt is considered one of the first major scientific discoveries in the Space Age. NASA launched the first weather satellite, the Television and Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) in 1960. Several other weather satellites were launched later by the US. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates monitor storms and other natural disasters using these satellites to provide critical data which helps to save lives and critical infrastructures. The American space agency has designed and launched several other missions to study and explore Earth, space, other planets and the Universe. Several Landsat satellites were sent to monitor Earth's land masses and for wider applications including surveying crops health, freshwater and forest management and infectious disease tracking. Nimbus satellites were launched beginning 1964 to measure the snow cover at the North and South poles, to estimate the size of volcanic eruptions and the distribution of phytoplankton in the oceans. It has also identified the ozone hole in Antarctica. The Mariner 2 mission launched in 1962 to Venus started the voyage to other planets to study them through close encounters. It was followed by a series of space missions to other solar bodies. The New Horizon mission launched in 2006 will make its visit to a distant asteroid in Kuiper belt known as 2014 MU69 on New Year 2019. This asteroid will be the first distant host of a human-made spacecraft. Meanwhile, the Voyager 1 mission has passed through the Kuiper belt boundaries into the interstellar space between stars. The Voyager 2 mission is currently traveling through the Heliosheath region in Kuiper belt. These missions were launched in 1977 for exploring unknown regions in the solar system and beyond it for aiding the future missions. Several major NASA missions including the Parker Solar Probe to study the Sun's atmosphere and the ultramodern James Webb Telescope to travel to the unknown regions in Universe are planned to be launched by this year and next year. These missions will change our perception of the Sun, the Solar system and the Universe as a whole.


*Elon Musk, the founder of private company SpaceX, is widely considered one of the strongest critic of artificial intelligence and he even stated that the advent of AI might turn into a dangerous weapon. He has also claimed that the potential outcome of artificial intelligence may turn out riskier than dealing with North Korea. But now, Eric Schmidt, the former executive chairman of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, Google's parent company, has lashed out against Musk's views stating that the SpaceX founder has a wrong perception regarding AI. All inventions have its own curse and boon During a speech delivered at the Viva Technology conference in Paris, France, Schmidt said that Elon Musk does not know the potential of artificial intelligence. "So, I believe that Elon is exactly wrong. So. My position is clear. And he is wrong because he doesn't understand the benefits that this technology will provide to making every human being smarter. And the fact of the matter is that AI and machine learning are so fundamentally good for humanity," said Schmidt, CNBC reported. During the speech, Schmidt argued that making people smarter by using artificial intelligence is good for the society. He added that Elon Musk has only thought about the potential misuse of this technology. "Over and over again, making people smarter is a net good. He is concerned about the possible misuse of this technology. And I am too. But today, the overwhelming benefit of this is positive. You would not invent the telephone because of the possible misuse of the telephone by evil people. No. You would build the telephone and you would try to figure out a way to police the misuse of the telephone," added Schmidt. He also believes the impact of artificial intelligence in the society will help to rectify the number of human errors. Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk criticize AI In February 2018, Elon Musk delivered a speech at the South by South West (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas and there he criticized the advent of AI as well as aurged with the authorities to frame regulations to make sure that everyone is regulating AI safely. "This is a situation where you have a very serious danger to the public. There needs to be a public body that has insight and oversight so that everyone is delivering AI safely. This is extremely important. My point was AI is far more dangerous than nukes. So why do we have no regulatory oversight? It's insane," said Musk. Previously, legendary theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking had also shared similar views regarding the dominance of AI in the human society. Several times he warned that emergence of artificial civilization could be the worst event in human history unless society finds a way to control its development.


*Monday, January 2, 2017 at 11:13 am | The damaged SpaceX launch complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida is seen Sept. 8, 2016, one week after the explosion. (Red Huber/Florida Today via AP) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to resume flying rockets next week following an investigation into why one of them burst into flames on a launch pad four months ago, the company said on Monday. In a statement, SpaceX said it expected to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base on Jan. 8 to put 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc . SpaceX had suspended flights after the same model rocket went up in a blaze on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test in Florida. The explosion at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida destroyed the $62 million rocket and a $200 million communications satellite. Space X, owned and operated by Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Officer Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion. The company statement said that accident investigators concluded that a canister of helium inside the rocket’s upper-stage oxygen tank had exploded. In the short term, SpaceX plans to revamp its fueling procedures so that the super-cold liquid oxygen will not build up between the helium tank’s liner and its outer covering, it added. SpaceX said accumulation of oxygen in a void or buckle in the liner most likely led to the explosion. “In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the (helium canisters) to prevent buckles altogether,” the statement said. The company did not say when new helium canisters would be ready to fly, but that using warmer temperature helium and a slower fueling operation will prevent them from bursting. “Iridium is pleased with SpaceX’s announcement on the results of the September 1 anomaly as identified by their accident investigation team, and their plans to target a return to flight,” company spokeswoman Diane Hockenberry said in a statement. SpaceX has not said how much damage the Sept. 1 accident did to its primary Florida launch pad, nor when a new second pad in Florida, located at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, will be put into service.


*In this photo provided by NASA, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft await liftoff from NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Aug. 14, 2017. (Photo: Kim Shiflett / AP) Cape Canaveral, Fla. — A SpaceX capsule rocketed to the International Space Station on Monday, carrying tons of science experiments, plus ice cream. As has become customary on these cargo flights, SpaceX landed its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral shortly after liftoff, a key to its long-term effort to recycle rockets and reduce costs. It was the 14th successful booster landing for SpaceX and the sixth on the giant X at the company’s designated touchdown spot at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just a few miles from its NASA-leased pad at Kennedy Space Center. “X marks the spot for yet another picture-perfect landing,” announced SpaceX Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo, which should reach the orbiting lab Wednesday. That includes 20 mice that will return alive inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule in about a month. The Dragon is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. She’s due back at the beginning of September. Newly arrived U.S. spaceman Randolph Bresnik turns 50 next month. The space station was zooming 250 miles above the Atlantic, just off Nova Scotia, when the Falcon took flight. The mice are part of a study aimed at better understanding visual problems suffered in space by some male astronauts. Scientists will study the pressure in the animals’ eyes, as well as the movement of fluid in their brains. Thirty days for mice in space is comparable to three years for humans, according to Florida State University Michael Delp, who’s in charge of the experiment. The investigation may help explain why female astronauts don’t have this vision problem, which can linger long after spaceflight, he added. The Dragon also holds an instrument to measure cosmic rays from the space station. This type of device has previously flown on high-altitude balloons. The Army has an imaging microsatellite on board for release this fall from the station. It’s a technology demo; the military wants to see how small satellites like this, with low-cost, off-the-shelf cameras and telescopes, might support critical ground operations. It’s about the size of a dormitory-room refrigerator. Also going up on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation: protein crystals that, in space, might shed light on Parkinson’s disease. The mission got a televised plug from Fox, an actor who has the disease. This is the 13th delivery by SpaceX , one of two private shippers hired by NASA. The other is Orbital ATK; its next supply run is in November from Wallops Island, Virginia. The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items intact to Earth. It parachutes into the Pacific. This particular Dragon is brand new, as is the Falcon rocket. In June, SpaceX launched its first reused Dragon, and in March, its first reused Falcon. From now on, the company said it may only fly used Dragons. SpaceX is also developing a crew Dragon for NASA astronauts, set to debut next year. Boeing is working on its own capsule to ferry space station astronauts. In the meantime, SpaceX is aiming for a November debut of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which will feature three first-stage boosters and 27 engines, versus the single booster and nine engines on the Falcon 9. It will have two-thirds the thrust of NASA’s Saturn V rocket, which was used during the Apollo moon program. All three of the Falcon Heavy’s first-stage boosters are meant to fly back to a touchdown.

*Long March 2D sends Zhangheng-1 seismo-electromagnetic spacecraft and six small satellites into space Tomasz Nowakowski China launched its first seismo-electromagnetic satellite, known as Zhangheng-1 on Friday, Feb. 2, atop a Long March 2D rocket. Six other smaller satellites also piggybacked on the mission. The flight highlighted China’s growing space ambitions. The mission lifted off into the sky at 7:51 GMT (2:51 a.m. EST) from Launch Area 4 (LA-4) at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (JSLC) in China’s Gansu Province. Chinese media has not disclosed any details about the preparations for the mission or about the Long March 2D’s ride to space. Officials postponed the mission from Aug. 16, 2017. As of this writing, they have not offered any explanation behind this move. The Long March 2D’s flight most likely concluded within 10 minutes after liftoff, given that it delivered its passengers into a Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). The nominal flight timeline of this rocket includes first stage separation about two and a half minutes after launch, and payload fairing detachment approximately one minute later. Therefore, the second stage controls the flight for the remaining 7 to 8 minutes in order to deploy the payload into targeted orbit. The success of the mission was confirmed by the state-run Xinhua press agency, within 50 minutes after leaving the pad. The primary payload of Friday’s mission was the Zhangheng-1 experimental seismo-electromagnetic satellite, also known as the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES). The mission is a joint Chinese-Italian project dedicated to the observation of ionospheric precursors of earthquakes. Zhangheng-1 was inserted into a SSO at an altitude of about 310 miles (500 kilometers), inclined 98 degrees. It will now be jointly operated by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and Italian Space Agency (ASI) for a period of up to five years. If everything works as advertised, the satellite should measure high-energy particles, plasma, electric and magnetic fields with a set of scientific instruments, including a High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD) and a Search-Coil Magnetometer (SCM). The spacecraft is called an “earthquake investigator” as it should allow scientists to monitor electromagnetic and atmospheric phenomena, and study correlations with the occurrence of seismic events. It should also provide insights into solar-terrestrial interactions, including phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). “It will help scientists monitor the electromagnetic field, ionospheric plasma and high-energy particles for an expected mission life of five years,” said Zhao Jian, a senior official with China National Space Administration (CNSA). Zhangheng-1 was built by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) and is based on the company’s CAST2000 platform. The spacecraft weighs in at about 1,610 lbs. (730 kilograms) and is fitted with a lone deployable solar array. The secondary payload for Friday’s mission includes the GomX-4A and GomX-4B six-unit CubeSats built by the Danish GomSpace company, ÑuSat 4 and ÑuSat 5 satellites for the Argentinian company Satellogic, and also FengMaNiu-1 and Shaonian Xing CubeSats for China. GomX-4A will be operated by the Danish Ministry of Defence and was sent aloft so as to serve as a technology demonstrator. The satellite has the main goal of identifying best-practice and future efforts reinforcing Denmark’s surveillance of the Arctic. It is fitted with radio receivers capable of capturing position signals from ships and aircraft. GomX-4B, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), will test inter-satellite links and propulsive orbit control techniques for future constellation operations with GomX-4A. The CubeSat also carries the Cubesat Highly Integrated Memory Radiation Assurance experiment, known as Chimera, which is designed to test how ‘commercial-off-the-shelf’ (COTS) parts cope with bombardments of high-energy electrically charged atomic particles from the Sun and deep space. “The GOMX-4B satellite is the most advanced satellite design we have initiated to date and we are very happy that ESA will participate in this project that will demonstrate possibilities of satellites flying in formation, assess the tandem effect synergy that open the doors to commercial opportunities for using the platform in future constellations for our customers,” said Niels Buus, CEO of GomSpace. ÑuSat 4 and ÑuSat 5 are Earth-observing satellites built and operated by Satellogic. Both spacecraft are identical and weigh approximately 81.5 lbs. (37 kilograms). The duo should replenish Satellogic’s Aleph-1 constellation aimed to deliver commercial Earth-observing services. When completed, the project is planned to consist of some 25 spacecraft orbiting in SSO at an altitude of about 300 miles (480 kilometers). Meanwhile, FengMaNiu-1 (or FMN-1) is a technology demonstrator developed by Link Space Aerospace Technology Inc., which will be used by the company to test new optical components in space. It will also be used as a repeater for amateurs worldwide via the onboard transponder system. The satellite is a three-unit CubeSat weighing around 6.6 lbs. (3 kilograms). According to Link Space, it will take some time to obtain first results from FengMaNiu-1’s optical system. “We will see the panoramic photo and video in a week,” the company tweeted. Shaonian Xing (“Youth Star” in Chinese) is a three-unit CubeSat with a mass of about 4.4 lbs. (2 kilograms), it was developed by teenagers as part of the Sat-China outreach project. The small satellite will be employed to engage youth into thinking about space, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) education, and satellite development. The Long March 2D launcher that was selected for Friday’s flight is a two-stage rocket developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology. It is mainly used to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO). The 135 foot (41.15 meters) tall booster can launch payloads of up to 3.5 metric tons to LEO and has an SSO capability of up to 1.3 metric tons. The rocket was launched for the first time on Aug. 9, 1992, from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, orbiting the Fanhui Shei Weixing FSW-2-1 recoverable satellite. Friday’s flight was the 266th launch of the Long March rocket series and the third mission conducted from JSLC in 2018. China’s next orbital mission is currently slated to take place on February 11, when a Long March 3B booster will deliver the newest duo of BeiDou-3 navigation satellites into space. China has some 40 missions planned for 2018, marking one of the most ambitious launch manifests of the year.


*Dawn spacecraft captures new images of Ceres’ Occator Crater Jason Rhian NASA’s Dawn spacecraft has entered into its final planned orbital position from which it will study the dwarf planet Ceres, the lowest the probe has descended to the tiny world since it arrived in orbit on March 6, 2015. The probe is powered by three xenon ion thrusters and it enter into its new orbit around the dwarf planet on June 6, 2018. Since then, the spacecraft has begun beaming back to Earth stunning new and closer images of this tiny worldlet. One of Dawn’s targets is Occator Crater. While the name might not ring a bell even among space enthusiasts, the “bright spots” contained within the crater should. These deposits are thought to be salt from briny water that erupted from the dwarf planet’s surface before sublimating. It was found that the bright regions were comprised of sodium carbonate. On Earth, these salts are left behind when water evaporates. Dawn was instructed to fire its ion engine—for what could be the last time—last week. By carrying out this maneuver, the probe flew closer to the dwarf planet’s Cerealia Facula. This is the region of Occator Crater that contains a large deposit of sodium carbonate. “Acquiring these spectacular pictures has been one of the greatest challenges in Dawn’s extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition, and the results are better than we had ever hoped,” said Marc Rayman, Dawn’s chief engineer and project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in news release. “Dawn is like a master artist, adding rich details to the otherworldly beauty in its intimate portrait of Ceres.” Dawn was directed into its last orbit, where it will arc over the tiny planetoid again and again, peering down from an estimated 22 miles (35 kilometers) above the dwarf planet’s surface. “The first views of Ceres obtained by Dawn beckoned us with a single, blinding bright spot,” said Carol Raymond of JPL, Dawn’s principal investigator. “Unraveling the nature and history of this fascinating dwarf planet during the course of Dawn’s extended stay at Ceres has been thrilling, and it is especially fitting that Dawn’s last act will provide rich new data sets to test those theories.” It is hoped that the spacecraft’s closer position will bring its features into sharper focus. According to NASA, researchers will employ the spacecraft’s visible and infrared mapping spectrometer as well as other instruments (which include a gamma ray and neutron detector as well as a visible and infrared mapping spectrometer) to study the dwarf planet’s features in greater detail. Before its recent descent, the closest Dawn had traveled to Ceres was 240 miles (385 kilometers). Now more than 200 miles closer in, the differences between the bright and dark regions in the Vinalia Faculae region of the dwarf planet are expected to be more obvious. Dawn was constructed by Orbital Sciences and is operated by JPL, which is located in Pasadena, California. More of the vehicle’s images can be seen here. Rayman is providing updates about the spacecraft’s discoveries in orbit above the dwarf planet, which can be viewed here: Dawn Journal.


*Israel Aerospace teams with Czech co Aero Vodochody on jets 2018-04-24 20:44 | www.trend.az | 2 Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. (IAI) has signed a partnership agreement for technical and marketing cooperation with Czech aircraft manufacturer Aero Vodochody, which specializes in military light jets, Globes reports. The cooperation draws on the tradition and experience of Aero Vodochody in the field of military light jet aircraft, the L-159 proven robust platform which has been successfully operated and tested in NATO joint operations, Red Air exercises and real combat missions, and IAI's innovative and cutting-edge technologies. The partners have agreed to integrate new state-of-the-art avionics and other solutions, on the L-159 platform , and to jointly market the aircraft. This approach is focused on further strengthening the already proven L-159 and enhance its position in the light attack market. Aero Vodochody president & CEO Giuseppe Giordo said, "Together with IAI, Aero will be ready to offer aircraft with the best available technology. The agreement brings us together with a strong international partner with access to new potential customers."


*Puerto Rico’s power grid has been practically demolished in the wake of hurricane Maria. It now has a once in a lifetime opportunity to rebuild and the island’s governor Ricardo Rossello wants to have a chat with Elon Musk about his recent offer to use Tesla batteries and solar power for the the job. Only 10 percent of the island has power at the moment and, according to the Puerto Rico state-owned electric company, some communities won’t be able to turn the lights back on for four to six months. Musk tweeted yesterday he could be the one to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electricity system using independent batteries and solar power. “The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” Musk wrote back. The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017 Governor Rossello tweeted at Musk shortly after with, “Let’s talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your # TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project.” As the Government’s CINO, I fully support this! Let’s build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation #letstalk @prstateits — Glorimar Ripoll (@prstatecino) October 6, 2017 Puerto Rico’s chief innovation officer Glorimar Ripoli is also on board. “As the Government’s CINO, I fully support this! Let’s build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation,” she tweeted. The real question is if this talking will turn into action. Tesla has already shipped hundreds of its Powerwall battery systems to Puerto Rico and Tesla employees are currently busy installing them and training locals how to continue the process. Musk also has a history of turning Twitter chats into something more. He struck a deal to build a battery plant in South Australia based on a tweet with Atlassian founder and Australian Mike Cannon-Brookes last March. Musk broke ground on the deal last month and stands to lose $50 million if he doesn’t complete the job within 100 days. As Musk mentioned in his tweet, Tesla has created a battery and solar power grid for other islands, like the Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative in Hawaii and in American Samoa. Of course, those projects were for much smaller populations than Puerto Rico. But Musk seems confident his system can scale to meet the demands of the island’s 3.4 million citizens.

*SpaceX has successfully launched yet another rocket, this one carrying a Dragon capsule loaded with over 6,400 pounds of cargo destined for the International Space Station. That makes an even dozen for ISS resupply missions launched by SpaceX under contract to NASA, and this is the most significant thus far in terms of potential scientific impact. CRS-12’s payload was over 75 percent committed to hauling equipment and material for experiments and scientific research, which is more than on any other previous mission. Typically, the Dragon is loaded down with a greater percentage of supplies for the astronauts on board ISS, but this was intended more to set the stage for a range of experiments to be conducted by researchers on board the ISS during this year and in 2018. There’s even an AR system on board designed to help astronauts improve their general efficiency. The rocket successfully launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center at 12:31 PM EDT, and Dragon deployed from the second stage as planned. Dragon will rendezvous with the ISS on August 16 for capture by the station’s Canadarm 2 robotic appendage, after which it’ll be attached to the rocket. After roughly a month, it’ll return to Earth after leaving the ISS with around 3,000 pounds of returned cargo on board, and splash down in the Pacific Ocean for recovery. There’s another reason this launch was significant, aside from its experimental payload (which included a supercomputer designed to help humans travel to Mars): SpaceX will only use re-used Dragon capsules for all future CRS missions, the company has announced, meaning this is the last time a brand new Dragon will be used to resupply the ISS, if all goes to plan. Today’s launch also included an attempt to recover the Falcon 9 first stage for re-use at SpaceX’s land-based LZ-1 landing pad. The Falcon 9 first stage returned to Earth as planned, and touched down at Cape Canaveral roughly 9 minutes after launch.


*SpaceX has concluded its investigation into the cause of an accident on a Cape Canaveral launchpad during which one of its rockets exploded, the company reported Monday. The investigation, conducted in partnership with federal safety and space agencies including the FAA and NASA, involved closely reviewing all recorded materials and data, as well as running tests at SpaceX’s facilities in Hawthorne, CA and McGregor, TX. The results of the investigation point to the issue that caused a Falcon 9 rocket to explode in September during pre-launch fueling. SpaceX’s investigation team found that there was a failure of a pressure vessel found inside a tank used to store liquid oxygen for the rocket’s second stage fuel burn. The problem in this case was that oxygen built up between the liner and overwrap of the vessel, which was probably made worse by loading helium so cold it turned the pooled oxygen from liquid to solid. SpaceX says it will enact both short- and long-term fixes to address these problems and is confident they will ensure a safe fueling process both immediately and in the future. Now that the investigation is concluded, SpaceX hopes to get back to flying on January 8, the target date for its launch with client Iridium satellites. SpaceX will use a Falcon 9 to deliver a payload of 10 Iridium satellites to orbit, which the telecommunications network is using to create a voice and data network. The satellites from Iridium are already loaded into the Falcon 9’s transport capsule. If SpaceX does indeed meet their launch window and successfully return to active mission status, their turnaround time between the September accident and getting back to launches will be unprecedented, and would go a long way toward returning full confidence to the other clients on its launch manifest.


*UPDATE: This launch has been moved and is now targeting the backup window of Wednesday, December 13 at 8:24 AM PST (11:24 AM EST). The live stream will be available 15 minutes prior to that time above. SpaceX is launching a space station resupply mission later this morning, with an instantaneous launch window opening at 8:46 AM PST (11:46 AM EST) from its LC-40 launch site at Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force base. The mission is a historic first for SpaceX – it’s the first time that the private space company will launch a refurbished, previously launched Dragon spacecraft using a Falcon 9 first stage booster that has also already been flown before. In other words, it’ll be the closest SpaceX has come yet to its vision of totally reusable space launch operations. The Falcon 9 booster being used today few during a previously ISS resupply mission, CRS-11 earlier this year in June, and the Dragon was flown in 2015 during another commercial resupply effort. The cargo today is around 4,800 pounds of supplies and scientific experimentation support material for research being conducted on the ISS. Dragon will stay at the ISS for around a month docked for unloading and reloading with return cargo from the ISS, before returning to Earth, and SpaceX will also try to recover the Falcon 9 first stage once again with a landing at its LZ-1 facility at Cape Canaveral. There’s a backed window set for 8:24 AM PST (11:24 AM EST) tomorrow, should the launch today need to be postponed. The live stream above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the scheduled launch window, or at around 11:30 AM PST.


*SpaceX is launching a Dragon spacecraft using a Falcon 9 rocket on Monday, with a launch window set for 12:31 PM EDT (9:31 PM PDT). The mission is CRS-12, the twelfth commercial resupply mission conducted by SpaceX, which is set to deliver a payload of over 6,400 pounds of supplies and experimental support materials to the International Space Station. The launch’s payload includes a new supercomputer from Hewlett Packard Enterprises, which will test whether so-called ‘software hardening’ can be used to make a stock supercomputer from Earth suitable for use in space during long durations – including over the course of a potential mission to Mars. This Dragon capsule will carry more materials for science and experiments than previous resupply missions form SpaceX, with 75 percent of the capsule’s weight assigned to supplies for over 250 experiments including testing things like the genetic causes of Parkinson’s disease, radiation’s effect on roundworm and more, extending the shelf life of pharmaceuticals and more. SpaceX will be launching from its LC-39A launch facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and today’s launch will include attempting to land and recover the Falcon 9’s fist stage at LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Dragon capsule used will return to earth after around one month in orbit, carrying 3,000 pounds of goods from the ISS for the return flight. The live stream above should go live around 15 minutes prior to the opening of the launch window, so at around 12:16 PM EDT (9:16 AM PDT).

*SpaceX is hosting its second Hyperloop Pod Competition this August, during the weekend spanning the 25th through the 27th. Participants will include those who successfully tested their pods during the first competition in January, as well as some who weren’t able to compete during that trial either due to time constraints or designs that didn’t quite meet SpaceX’s requirements. The competitors are not directly affiliated with SpaceX – they include 27 teams selected from a larger group, mostly made up of research teams from some of the best colleges and universities from the U.S. and around the world. The first time around, the competitors were focused on a variety of criteria, but this time, there’s just one metric that matters: max speed. That’s the kind of heart-pounding thrill ride we’re looking for out of Hyperloop – on top of safety of course. Safety first. And then second, F9: Fast and Furious and Hyperloop, the next instalment in the blockbuster film franchise. The family faces its biggest challenge yet in a low atmosphere contained tube environment.

*Puerto Rico’s power grid has been practically demolished in the wake of hurricane Maria. It now has a once in a lifetime opportunity to rebuild and the island’s governor Ricardo Rossello wants to have a chat with Elon Musk about his recent offer to use Tesla batteries and solar power for the the job.

*FILE PHOTO: Guitarist Paul Kantner of the band "Jefferson Starship" plays on stage during the "Summer of Love" 40th anniversary concert at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California September 2, 2007. (Reuters) - A founding member of Jefferson Starship may pursue part of his lawsuit seeking to stop former bandmates from using the rock group's name, a federal judge ruled on Friday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James said the guitarist Craig Chaquico may pursue a breach of contract claim against David Freiberg, Donny Baldwin and other musicians for performances and merchandising since January 2016, when co-founder Paul Kantner died. The San Francisco-based judge also dismissed Chaquico's claim for earlier alleged contract breaches, and a trademark claim over the use of his likeness. David Swift, a lawyer for Chaquico, in an email said he was pleased his client can pursue his "core" claim. "It is important to Mr. Chaquico to protect the legacy of Jefferson Starship by preventing unauthorised bands, like defendants in the case, from using the iconic name," he said. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to court papers, members of Jefferson Starship agreed to retire the name in 1985 after Kantner left. Eight years later, Chaquico allowed Kantner, "and only Kantner," to use the name in connection with live performances and merchandise, the complaint said. James said that when Freiberg and Baldwin later joined Kantner's revamped Jefferson Starship lineup, their use of the name was "related to Kantner's use," but this ended after his death. In dismissing the trademark claim, the judge said Chaquico failed to show how the public, and especially fans "more likely to be familiar with the history of Jefferson Starship and its multiple iterations," would be confused about his involvement. The band was an outgrowth of Jefferson Airplane, which was founded in the 1960s and is remembered for now-classic songs such as "Somebody to Love" and "White Rabbit," which featured singer Grace Slick. In the mid-1980s, following Kantner's departure, it evolved into Starship, where Slick and singer Mickey Thomas were featured on the No. 1 hits "We Built This City" and "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now." The case is Chaquico v Freiberg et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-02423.

*Four months after a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a Florida launch pad, SpaceX has determined that the cause was a failed composite overwrapped pressure vessel used to store liquid helium. In the final update to its investigation released Monday, the Hawthorne space company said one of three such tanks in the rocket’s larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank failed, probably after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel’s aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited. In November, SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk described the cause of the explosion as something that has “never been encountered before in the history of rocketry.” The company said its accident investigation team — made up of officials from SpaceX, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and industry experts — found “buckles,” or valleys, in the vessels’ inner liners. Super-chilled liquid oxygen can gather in buckles, and when pressurized, the oxygen can get trapped. Then, “breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap,” causing the vessel to fail, SpaceX said. The company also said the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, “which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.” To fix this issue in the short term, SpaceX said it will change the configuration of the composite overwrapped pressure vessels “to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded.” It will also change helium loading operations to a “prior flight proven configuration” that is based on procedures that were used in hundreds of successful loads. SpaceX plans to eventually change the design of the vessels to prevent buckles, which the company said will allow for faster loading operations. The company is now targeting Jan. 8 for its return to flight, pending FAA approval.

*Elon Musk has big dreams for Puerto Rico. On Thursday, the Tesla Inc. chief executive said he would discuss building a high-tech solar grid for the island with Ricardo Rossello, Puerto Rico's governor. "Let's talk," Rossello tweeted at Musk. "I would be happy to talk," Musk replied. "Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful." Although Musk's idea doesn't solve Puerto Rico's current crisis — 90% of the island is still without power, and many are having trouble getting clean water — it could set the island on the path to sustainable, renewable energy, which could reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels and ultimately bolster its economy. The proposal, in other words, makes a great deal of sense, even if it doesn't help right away. Puerto Rico's electric company already was in shambles. In July, it basically filed for bankruptcy, saying it owed $9 billion and needed an additional $4 billion to revamp its power plants, whose median age is 40 years old. That was before Hurricane Maria struck. Now, in light of the damage to Puerto Rico's electric grid, people such as Musk are seeing the crisis as a chance for the island to move away from centralized, vulnerable electricity systems. "The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR," Musk posted Thursday on Twitter. Among the "many smaller islands" to which Musk is referring is the island of Ta'u in American Samoa. Last year, Tesla said it had wired Ta'u with thousands of solar panels and batteries that would meet nearly all of the energy needs of its 600 residents. It was an example of how, under the right conditions, an island population could shift almost entirely away from fossil fuels. According to Musk, there's no reason something similar couldn't be achieved in Puerto Rico. Musk isn't exactly going out on a limb here. Scientists and energy experts say that a distributed grid that doesn't rely on a single power plant for energy generation could help vulnerable island regions such as the Caribbean weather strong storms like Irma or Maria. Solar panels, which can feed their power into batteries and be linked together into local or regional power grids, are one example of a technology that could spread the potential risk out across a population. And at tropical latitudes, you get the most bang for your solar buck: Photovoltaic panels located there are even more effective at energy generation than they are at higher latitudes. The long-term economic benefits could be equally transformative. Island residents face some of the highest energy prices in the world because the vast majority of their fuel must be imported. Reducing those fuel costs by switching to wind or solar could permanently set these island economies on a more positive trajectory. "When we are facing the sort of infrastructure destruction we have seen this hurricane season, it only makes sense to give some pause before reinvesting in the exact same system that proved too vulnerable," Gwen Holdmann, who directs the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said in an email. "If [Puerto Rico's] system were redesigned around microgrids incorporating local power production," Holdmann said, "there would still be losses, but the number and duration of outages due to severe weather events would decrease." So it's really no surprise to see solar advocates such as Musk reaching out to Puerto Rico. CAPTION The Las Vegas gunman researched outdoor performance areas in other large cities in recent months.

*Elon Musk has big dreams for Puerto Rico. On Thursday, the Tesla Inc. chief executive said he would discuss building a high-tech solar grid for the island with Ricardo Rossello, Puerto Rico's governor. "Let's talk," Rossello tweeted at Musk. "I would be happy to talk," Musk replied. "Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful." Although Musk's idea doesn't solve Puerto Rico's current crisis — 90% of the island is still without power, and many are having trouble getting clean water — it could set the island on the path to sustainable, renewable energy, which could reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels and ultimately bolster its economy. The proposal, in other words, makes a great deal of sense, even if it doesn't help right away. Puerto Rico's electric company already was in shambles. In July, it basically filed for bankruptcy, saying it owed $9 billion and needed an additional $4 billion to revamp its power plants, whose median age is 40 years old. That was before Hurricane Maria struck. Now, in light of the damage to Puerto Rico's electric grid, people such as Musk are seeing the crisis as a chance for the island to move away from centralized, vulnerable electricity systems. "The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR," Musk posted Thursday on Twitter. Among the "many smaller islands" to which Musk is referring is the island of Ta'u in American Samoa. Last year, Tesla said it had wired Ta'u with thousands of solar panels and batteries that would meet nearly all of the energy needs of its 600 residents. It was an example of how, under the right conditions, an island population could shift almost entirely away from fossil fuels. According to Musk, there's no reason something similar couldn't be achieved in Puerto Rico. Musk isn't exactly going out on a limb here. Scientists and energy experts say that a distributed grid that doesn't rely on a single power plant for energy generation could help vulnerable island regions such as the Caribbean weather strong storms like Irma or Maria. Solar panels, which can feed their power into batteries and be linked together into local or regional power grids, are one example of a technology that could spread the potential risk out across a population. And at tropical latitudes, you get the most bang for your solar buck: Photovoltaic panels located there are even more effective at energy generation than they are at higher latitudes. The long-term economic benefits could be equally transformative. Island residents face some of the highest energy prices in the world because the vast majority of their fuel must be imported. Reducing those fuel costs by switching to wind or solar could permanently set these island economies on a more positive trajectory. "When we are facing the sort of infrastructure destruction we have seen this hurricane season, it only makes sense to give some pause before reinvesting in the exact same system that proved too vulnerable," Gwen Holdmann, who directs the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said in an email.

So it's really no surprise to see solar advocates such as Musk reaching out to Puerto Rico. CAPTION The Las Vegas gunman researched outdoor performance areas in other large cities in recent months.

*Four months after a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a Florida launch pad, SpaceX has determined that the cause was a failed composite overwrapped pressure vessel used to store liquid helium. In the final update to its investigation released Monday, the Hawthorne space company said one of three such tanks in the rocket’s larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank failed, probably after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel’s aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited. In November, SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk described the cause of the explosion as something that has “never been encountered before in the history of rocketry.” The company said its accident investigation team — made up of officials from SpaceX, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and industry experts — found “buckles,” or valleys, in the vessels’ inner liners. Super-chilled liquid oxygen can gather in buckles, and when pressurized, the oxygen can get trapped. Then, “breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap,” causing the vessel to fail, SpaceX said. The company also said the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, “which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.” To fix this issue in the short term, SpaceX said it will change the configuration of the composite overwrapped pressure vessels “to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded.” It will also change helium loading operations to a “prior flight proven configuration” that is based on procedures that were used in hundreds of successful loads. SpaceX plans to eventually change the design of the vessels to prevent buckles, which the company said will allow for faster loading operations. The company is now targeting Jan. 8 for its return to flight, pending FAA approval.

*None of the site's historic buildings would be altered or used in the proposed project, Cannon said during the meeting. He noted that the site, which has been idle "for a long time," has been used for filming. Construction would take 16 to 18 months and would include up to four above-ground storage tanks. Cannon did not elaborate on the use for the tanks.


*WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- SpaceX rockets may return to flight as early as Sunday, according to the company. The news comes following an in-depth investigation into the explosion of a rocket from SpaceX's September mission. The company said in a statement Monday the botched launch was due to a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank. The vessel buckled, causing liquid oxygen to accumulate. It believes this led to friction, sparks and the explosion. SpaceX conducted the investigation along with officials from NASA, the Federal Aviation Authority, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board. The Federal Aviation Administration will have to sign off on the report and issue SpaceX a license to launch. SpaceX appears optimistic it will be launching rockets again soon. To prevent such an incident from happening again, SpaceX will now load its rockets with warmer helium and revert to its older, proven method of loading helium. Down the road, it plans to change the design of its pressure vessels. SpaceX originally intended to return to space by November. Shortly after the investigation begin, CEO Elon Musk called it the most difficult and complex failure of the company's 14-year existence. The company has drawn praise for its low-cost rockets and wowed spectators by landing rockets on a platform at sea. However, the company has also been dogged by mishaps, such as this fall's explosion. SpaceX holds a NASA contact to carry U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station, but for now, it plans to catch up on delayed launches.

*New Delhi: The US-based electric car major Tesla is in discussion with Indian government seeking relief on import duties till a local factory is built here, according to the company's Chief Executive Elon Musk. Earlier this year, Musk had stated that he was hoping for Tesla to enter India this summer with its products, which has so far not materialised. "In discussion with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built," Musk said in a tweet. At present, India imposes 60 percent customs duty on import of completely-built electric cars priced less than US $40,000. If the electric car is assembled in India, the customs duty on the completely knocked down units is 10 percent. If the value of the imported car is more than US $40,000 the customs duty is 100 percent. Replying to Musk's tweet, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar asked if there was an option to import some right hand drive Model X in India and indicated that, if so he would pay full duties. Last year in April, Tesla had stated that it planned to enter India with its Model 3 in 2017 while it began global rollout of the vehicle in late 2016. Model 3 is Tesla's most affordable car yet and achieves 215 miles of range per charge while starting at US $35,000 before incentives. The company's other models include Model S and Model X. Musk has been showing increasing interest in the country of late and had earlier this month tweeted about India's commitment to sell only electric cars by 2030. "It is already the largest market for solar power," he had tweeted. Mahindra group Chairman Anand Mahindra responded to Musk's tweet in a lighter vein saying, "time you got out here Elon. You don't want to leave that whole market to Mahindra do you?? The more the merrier- and greener !"


*NASA's Dawn spacecraft is sending back incredible close-ups of the dwarf planet Ceres. The spacecraft has been circling Ceres since 2015. In June, it reached its lowest orbit yet, skimming the surface from just 35 kilometers up. The latest pictures released on Monday offer unprecedented views of a huge impact crater known for its bright salty deposits. Landslides are clearly visible on the rim. Chief engineer Marc Rayman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, says the results are better than hoped. Before arriving at Ceres, Dawn explored the asteroid Vesta. Both are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Launched in 2007 with an ion engine, Dawn is nearing the end of its extended mission. NASA expects the spacecraft to last just another few months.


*SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 6,400 pounds of supplies to the International Space Station including 20 live mice and some ice cream. The rocket launched a Dragon capsule from Kennedy Space Center, on its way to the international Space Station. It catches up with the orbiting lab Wednesday. On board – 20 live mice that will be used to study the effects of long-duration space flight. Florida State University researcher Michael Delp wants to solve some biological problems astronauts face in space. To do that, he’s sending the group of mice to the station. For nearly a month, the mice will live in micro-gravity. “The research is really geared to address several biomedical issues that face astronauts with long-duration space flight,” said Delp. Also on board – ice cream. And not the freeze-dried stuff, either. NASA had extra freezer space on board, so it decided to send the six ISS astronauts vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream cups. After lofting the Dragon into orbit, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of the rocket back at Cape Canaveral.

*Consumer Reports reversed course Wednesday and endorsed the new Tesla Model 3 after previously declining to recommend the electric car, saying that the company had quickly improved the vehicle's brakes. The consumer advice publication's turnabout comes after a spat with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who called the initial review "very strange" and said reviewers had tested "an early production car." Musk's criticism came as he also bashed the news media in general in recent days over what he believes is unfair coverage. Consumer Reports said Tesla issued an over-the-air software update to improve the Model 3's brakes. The reviewers had originally reported a stopping distance that "was far worse than any contemporary car we've tested" and even longer than a full-size pickup. That was part of what reviewers called "big flaws," including difficult vehicle controls. Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, told USA TODAY that he spoke with Musk for an hour last week after the initial review was posted. Musk, he said, was "eager" to understand why Consumer Reports had experienced trouble with the Model 3. But he said Musk's public criticism did not affect the publication's shift. "There are still other flaws with the vehicle," Fisher said in an interview. "Those have not necessarily been addressed. It’s not the top in its category but it's certainly a vehicle that scores high enough to recommend." Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, discusses new technologies before an event for Tesla owners and the media held at the Hawthorne Airport. In the background is a Tesla model P85D.

*BLAST OFF! SpaceX plans to launch an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket with research and supplies at 12:31 p.m. More: http://bit.ly/2uD3C2Y Posted by WINK News on Monday, August 14, 2017 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) SpaceX just launched a few tons of research to the International Space Station – plus ice cream. An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket took off just after 12:30 p.m. Monday from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo. That includes 20 mice. The Dragon capsule is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream for the station’s crew of six, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. As usual on these cargo flights, SpaceX will try to land its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral.


*MIAMI: SpaceX on Monday (Aug 14) blasted off its unmanned Dragon cargo ship toward the International Space Station, carrying a host of science experiments and the most powerful computer ever sent into orbit. "Three, two, one, and liftoff," a SpaceX commentator said as the white Falcon 9 rocket climbed into the blue sky over Cape Canaveral, Florida at 12:31 pm (1631 GMT). Three minutes after launch, the rocket separated as planned, with the long, tall portion - known as the first stage - arcing back toward Earth and the second stage continuing to propel the cargo ship to space. The first stage of the rocket then powered its thrusters and operated its grid fins to set itself down on solid ground at Cape Canaveral for a controlled, upright landing at Landing Zone 1. Clouds of brown dust encircled the rocket as it touched down. "X marks the spot for yet another picture perfect landing," a SpaceX commentator said. Advertisement Advertisement The California-based company, headed by Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk, has successfully landed multiple rockets on land and on ocean platforms, as part of its ongoing effort to re-use costly rocket components instead of jettisoning them into the ocean. Moments later, SpaceX confirmed that the Dragon had safely arrived in the correct orbit around the Earth. It will arrive at the ISS on Wednesday. The mission is the 12th of 20 supply trips under a US$1.6 billion SpaceX contract with NASA to send supplies to the astronauts living at the space station. The cargo ship is packed with 2,900 kilogrammes of supplies, including a sophisticated super-computer made by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), called The Spaceborne Computer. The goal is to test the computer for one year to see if it can operate in the harsh conditions of space, about the same amount of time as it would take for astronauts to arrive at Mars. If it survives the intense space radiation, such computers could help crew operate on long-duration missions to deep space. NASA has said it hopes to send the first astronauts to Mars by the 2030s.


*CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.: Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to resume flying rockets next week following an investigation into why one of them burst into flames on a launch pad four months ago, the company said on Monday. In a statement, SpaceX said it expected to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Jan. 8 to put 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc. SpaceX had suspended flights after the same model rocket went up in a blaze on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test in Florida. The explosion at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida destroyed the US$62 million rocket and a US$200 million communications satellite. Space X, owned and operated by Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Officer Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than US$10 billion. The company statement said that accident investigators concluded that a canister of helium inside the rocket’s upper-stage oxygen tank had exploded. In the short term, SpaceX plans to revamp its fueling procedures so that the super-cold liquid oxygen will not build up between the helium tank’s liner and its outer covering, it added. SpaceX said accumulation of oxygen in a void or buckle in the liner most likely led to the explosion. “In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the (helium canisters) to prevent buckles altogether,” the statement said. The company did not say when new helium canisters would be ready to fly, but that using warmer temperature helium and a slower fueling operation will prevent them from bursting. “Iridium is pleased with SpaceX’s announcement on the results of the September 1 anomaly as identified by their accident investigation team, and their plans to target a return to flight,” company spokeswoman Diane Hockenberry said in a statement. SpaceX has not said how much damage the Sept. 1 accident did to its primary Florida launch pad, nor when a new second pad in Florida, located at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, will be put into service.

*An industry that has long been important for Tulsa is now much more important for all Oklahomans. The Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission study shows that aviation and aerospace industries are booming across the state. The industry is behind only oil in its economic impact - supporting more than 200,000 jobs statewide with an $11.7 billion annual payroll. "The footprint of aviation and aerospace is strong and growing in the state of Oklahoma. In fact, it has grown since we last did this study. Aviation and aerospace and the footprint has grown 250 percent," said Gov. Mary Fallin.


*Space may be the final frontier, but it’s an expensive one to explore. There are ample problems with which to contend here on Earth, and that leads some people to wonder if space exploration is worth the hassle. At ExtremeTech, we believe the answer is unequivocally “yes.” Here are five reasons why space exploration is vital to humanity. New Technologies and Research Humans did not evolve to go into space, but we go there anyway. That has led to the development of various technologies that feed back into the economy and improve our lives on Earth. Without space programs, we wouldn’t have GPS, accurate weather prediction, solar cells, or the ultraviolet filters in sunglasses and cameras. There’s also medical research happening in space right now that could cure diseases and prolong human lives, and these experiments can’t be done on Earth. Space exploration could save your life. Asteroids and Comets Don’t Care About Us Speaking of saving lives, space exploration could save all our lives. Our solar system has calmed down a lot since the early eons, but there are still uncountable big asteroids and comets out there that could smack into the planet and really ruin your day. It’s happened several times in the past, each one causing a mass extinction. It’s not a matter of if another large asteroid hits Earth, but when. A robust space program is the only hope we have of deflecting such an object. Colonization Is the Ultimate Backup There are currently more than 7 billion humans, which is a lot. However, we’re all crammed together on this one planet. If something happened to Earth, our species could be wiped out. For example, the aforementioned asteroid impact. Colonizing other bodies in the solar system is a way to create a “backup” of humanity that will survive no matter what happens to Earth. Maybe future humans will be Martians who will never set foot on Earth. Space Mining Could Save the World As we develop new technologies on Earth, the strain on our natural resources continues to increase. The extraction of valuable minerals has led to a host of problems, including environmental damage and human exploitation, but there’s a wealth of precious materials in space. Startups like Planetary Resources want to mine asteroids instead of Earth, which would mean an effectively unlimited supply of raw materials that are rare on Earth. We Are Explorers There are more practical reasons for space exploration, but one of the principle reasons we must continue is that we’re explorers. That’s why humans number in the billions — from our earliest upright steps, we’ve endeavored to learn more about the world around us, and this allowed us to build civilization. Exploring space is an opportunity not only to discover new worlds and build advanced technologies, but to work together toward a larger goal irrespective of nationality, race, or gender. If we stop exploring, we stop being human.
