# **RAG System for SpaceX Project**

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to handle queries specifically related to **SpaceX** and its operations. The solution leverages cutting-edge retrieval and language generation models to provide relevant answers to domain-specific questions.

## **Project Overview**

The project is structured into **two main parts**:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing** (`RAG_DataAcq_PreProcessing.ipynb`)
2. **RAG Pipeline Implementation** (`RAG_Pipline_Implementation.ipynb`)

Each part is contained in separate Jupyter notebooks, providing a structured flow from data collection to system integration.

### **Part 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**

**Notebook:** `RAG_DataAcq_PreProcessing.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook handles the initial steps of data gathering and preparation. It focuses on collecting, cleaning, and transforming various SpaceX-related datasets to serve as the knowledge base for the RAG system.

**Key Features:**

- **Dataset Download**: Fetches SpaceX-related text, audio, and video datasets using tools like `gdown` and `datasets`.
- **Text Extraction and Preprocessing**: Converts text data into a standardized format, cleans it, and splits it into smaller chunks.
- **Multimedia Processing**: Uses `whisper` and `ffmpeg` to transcribe audio and video files into text, making them accessible for the RAG model.
- **Data Storage**: Organizes and saves the cleaned datasets into a structured format for easy access in the next stage.

**Libraries Used:**

- `datasets`: For managing large-scale text datasets.
- `whisper`: For speech-to-text transcription.
- `ffmpeg-python`: For processing audio and video files.
- `gdown`: For downloading files from Google Drive.
- `os`, `re`: Standard Python libraries for file management and text processing.

### **Part 2: RAG Pipeline Implementation**

**Notebook:** `RAG_Pipline_Implementation.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook builds the full RAG system using preprocessed data. It integrates various models for retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base and generating coherent answers using a combination of retriever and language models.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Chunking**: Splits large documents into smaller chunks for effective retrieval.
- **Integration with Language Models**: Uses `LangChain` to connect retrieval and generation models.
- **Query Answering**: Sets up a pipeline that takes a user query, retrieves the most relevant text chunks, and generates a comprehensive answer using a generative model.
- **Testing and Evaluation**: Allows you to test the system by running sample queries and observing its responses.

**Libraries Used:**

- `langchain`: Manages the workflow of retrieval and language generation models.
- `google-generativeai`: Provides pre-trained models for natural language generation.
- `chromadb`: For building a vector store and performing fast similarity searches.
- `pypdf`: For extracting text from PDF documents.

## **How It Works**

The RAG system combines **retrieval** and **generation** to answer questions. Here’s a high-level view of how it works:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**:
   - Collects and preprocesses SpaceX-related datasets.
   - Transcribes and extracts text from multimedia files.
   - Stores the cleaned data in a structured format.

2. **RAG Pipeline**:
   - Loads the preprocessed data and splits it into chunks.
   - Converts these chunks into vector representations using embeddings.
   - For a given query, retrieves the most relevant chunks using similarity search.
   - Generates a coherent answer using a language model by conditioning it on the retrieved chunks.

3. **Query Example**:
   ```python
   Run_My_RAG("What are the latest developments in the Starship project?")
   ```

   The system will retrieve relevant text segments about the Starship project and provide a structured, generated response.

## **Instructions for Setting Up**

### **1. Prerequisites**

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed along with `pip` (Python package manager). It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### **2. Install Required Libraries**

Install all necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install langchain google-generativeai chromadb pypdf datasets whisper ffmpeg-python gdown
```

### **3. Download the Project Files**

1. Save the two notebooks:
   - `RAG_DataAcq_PreProcessing.ipynb`
   - `RAG_Pipline_Implementation.ipynb`

2. Place them in a directory named `RAG_SpaceX_Project` for easy navigation. (incase you want to change the directory name, make sure to update the paths in the notebooks if not the you can skip this step and run the downloading cell for the datasets in the notebook) 

### **4. Run the Data Acquisition Notebook**

1. Open the `RAG_DataAcq_PreProcessing.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run each cell in the notebook to:
   - Download the required datasets.
   - Preprocess the text and multimedia data.
   - Save the processed data in a designated folder (e.g., `RagProject/soundDataSete , RagProject/txtDataSete, etc `).

### **5. Run the RAG Pipeline Notebook**

1. Open the `RAG_Pipline_Implementation.ipynb` notebook.
2. Modify the paths in the notebook to point to your preprocessed data folder.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Load the preprocessed data.
   - Build the RAG pipeline.
   - Test the system with sample queries.

### **6. Testing the System**

After setting up the RAG pipeline, you can run sample queries as shown in the "How It Works" section. The system will provide answers based on the processed SpaceX knowledge base.
